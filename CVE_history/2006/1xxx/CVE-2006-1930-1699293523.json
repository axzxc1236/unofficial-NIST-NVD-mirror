NOTE: this issue has been disputed by the vendor, saying \"those parameters mentioned ARE checked (preg_match) before they are used in SQL-query...  If someone decided to add SQL-injection stuff to certain parameter, they would see an error text, but only because _nothing_ was passed inside that parameter (to MySQL-database).\"  As allowed by the vendor, CVE investigated this report on 20060525 and found that the demo site demonstrated a non-sensitive SQL error when given standard SQL injection manipulations.",
