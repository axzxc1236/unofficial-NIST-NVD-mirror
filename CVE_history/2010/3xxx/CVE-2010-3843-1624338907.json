      "type": "Description",
      "oldValue": "The gtkui_conf_read function in src/interfaces/gtk/ec_gtk_conf.c in Ettercap 0.7.3, when the GTK interface is used, does not ensure that the contents of the .ettercap_gtk file are controlled by the root user, which allows local users to conduct stack-based buffer overflow attacks and possibly execute arbitrary code, cause a denial of service (memory consumption), or possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted lines in this file.",
      "newValue": "The GTK version of ettercap uses a global settings file at /tmp/.ettercap_gtk and does not verify ownership of this file. When parsing this file for settings in gtkui_conf_read() (src/interfacesgtk/ec_gtk_conf.c), an unchecked sscanf() call allows a maliciously placed settings file to overflow a statically-sized buffer on the stack."
