      "oldValue": "It was discovered that Plone, included as a part of luci, did not properly protect the administrator interface (control panel). A remote attacker could use this flaw to inject a specially crafted Python statement or script into Plone's restricted Python sandbox that, when the administrator interface was accessed, would be executed with the privileges of that administrator user.",
      "newValue": "registerConfiglet.py in Plone before 4.2.3 and 4.3 before beta 1 allows remote attackers to execute Python code via unspecified vectors, related to the admin interface."
