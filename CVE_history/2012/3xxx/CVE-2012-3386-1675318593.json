      "oldValue": "The \"make distcheck\" rule in GNU Automake before 1.11.6 and 1.12.x before 1.12.2 grants world-writable permissions to the extraction directory, which introduces a race condition that allows local users to execute arbitrary code via unspecified vectors.",
      "newValue": "It was found that the distcheck rule in Automake-generated Makefiles made a directory world-writable when preparing source archives. If a malicious, local user could access this directory, they could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running \"make distcheck\"."
