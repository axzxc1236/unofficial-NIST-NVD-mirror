      "type": "Description",
      "oldValue": "Algorithmic complexity vulnerability in the ssl.match_hostname function in Python 3.2.x, 3.3.x, and earlier, and unspecified versions of python-backports-ssl_match_hostname as used for older Python versions, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via multiple wildcard characters in the common name in a certificate.",
      "newValue": "A denial of service flaw was found in the way Python's SSL module implementation performed matching of certain certificate names. A remote attacker able to obtain a valid certificate that contained multiple wildcard characters could use this flaw to issue a request to validate such a certificate, resulting in excessive consumption of CPU."
