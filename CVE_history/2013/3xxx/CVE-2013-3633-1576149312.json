      "newValue": "A vulnerability has been identified in SCALANCE X-200 switch family (incl. SIPLUS NET variants) (Versions < V5.0.0 for CVE-2013-3633 and versions < V4.5.0 for CVE-2013-3634), SCALANCE X-200IRT switch family (incl. SIPLUS NET variants) (All versions < V5.1.0). The user privileges for the web interface are only enforced on client side and not properly\nverified on server side. Therefore, an attacker is able to execute privileged commands\nusing an unprivileged account."
