      "oldValue": "The SNMPv3 functionality on Siemens Scalance X200 IRT switches with firmware before X-200IRT 5.1.0 does not properly validate credentials, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary SNMP commands by leveraging knowledge of a username.",
      "newValue": "A vulnerability has been identified in SCALANCE X-200 switch family (incl. SIPLUS NET variants) (Versions < V5.0.0 for CVE-2013-3633 and versions < V4.5.0 for CVE-2013-3634), SCALANCE X-200IRT switch family (incl. SIPLUS NET variants) (All versions < V5.1.0). The implementation of SNMPv3 does not check the user credentials sufficiently.\nTherefore, an attacker is able to execute SNMP commands without correct credentials."
