      "type": "Description",
      "oldValue": "It was found that getaddrinfo() did not limit the amount of stack memory used during name resolution. An attacker able to make an application resolve an attacker-controlled hostname or IP address could possibly cause the application to exhaust all stack memory and crash.",
      "newValue": "Stack-based buffer overflow in the getaddrinfo function in sysdeps/posix/getaddrinfo.c in GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) 2.18 and earlier allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a (1) hostname or (2) IP address that triggers a large number of AF_INET6 address results. NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2013-1914."
