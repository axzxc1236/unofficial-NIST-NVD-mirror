      "type": "Description",
      "oldValue": "The Linux kernel before 4.4.1 allows local users to bypass file-descriptor limits and cause a denial of service (memory consumption) by sending each descriptor over a UNIX socket before closing it, related to net/unix/af_unix.c and net/unix/garbage.c.",
      "newValue": "It was found that the Linux kernel did not properly account file descriptors passed over the unix socket against the process limit. A local user could use this flaw to exhaust all available memory on the system."
