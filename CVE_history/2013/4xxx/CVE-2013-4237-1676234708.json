      "type": "Description",
      "oldValue": "An out-of-bounds write flaw was found in the way the glibc's readdir_r() function handled file system entries longer than the NAME_MAX character constant. A remote attacker could provide a specially crafted NTFS or CIFS file system that, when processed by an application using readdir_r(), would cause that application to crash or, potentially, allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application.",
      "newValue": "sysdeps/posix/readdir_r.c in the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) 2.18 and earlier allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds write and crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted (1) NTFS or (2) CIFS image."
