      "oldValue": "Off-by-one error in the __gconv_translit_find function in gconv_trans.c in GNU C Library (aka glibc) allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) or execute arbitrary code via vectors related to the CHARSET environment variable and gconv transliteration modules.",
      "newValue": "An off-by-one heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in glibc's internal __gconv_translit_find() function. An attacker able to make an application call the iconv_open() function with a specially crafted argument could possibly use this flaw to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of that application."
