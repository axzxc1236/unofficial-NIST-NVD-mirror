      "type": "Description",
      "oldValue": "The memory resource controller (aka memcg) in the Linux kernel allows local users to cause a denial of service (deadlock) by spawning new processes within a memory-constrained cgroup.",
      "newValue": "It was found that the Linux kernel memory resource controller's (memcg) handling of OOM (out of memory) conditions could lead to deadlocks. An attacker able to continuously spawn new processes within a single memory-constrained cgroup during an OOM event could use this flaw to lock up the system."
