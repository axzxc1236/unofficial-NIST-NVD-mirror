      "type": "Description",
      "oldValue": "The InfiniBand (IB) implementation in the Linux kernel package before 2.6.32-504.12.2 on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 6 does not properly restrict use of User Verbs for registration of memory regions, which allows local users to access arbitrary physical memory locations, and consequently cause a denial of service (system crash) or gain privileges, by leveraging permissions on a uverbs device under /dev/infiniband/.",
      "newValue": "It was found that the Linux kernel's Infiniband subsystem did not properly sanitize input parameters while registering memory regions from user space via the (u)verbs API. A local user with access to a /dev/infiniband/uverbsX device could use this flaw to crash the system or, potentially, escalate their privileges on the system."
