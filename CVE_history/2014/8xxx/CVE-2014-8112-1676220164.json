This could potentially allow an authenticated user able to access the Changelog to read sensitive information.",
      "newValue": "389 Directory Server 1.3.1.x, 1.3.2.x before 1.3.2.27, and 1.3.3.x before 1.3.3.9 stores \"unhashed\" passwords even when the nsslapd-unhashed-pw-switch option is set to off, which allows remote authenticated users to obtain sensitive information by reading the Changelog."
