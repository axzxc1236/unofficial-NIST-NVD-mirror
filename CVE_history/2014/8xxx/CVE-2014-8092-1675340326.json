      "oldValue": "Multiple integer overflows in X.Org X Window System (aka X11 or X) X11R1 and X.Org Server (aka xserver and xorg-server) before 1.16.3 allow remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted request to the (1) ProcPutImage, (2) GetHosts, (3) RegionSizeof, or (4) REQUEST_FIXED_SIZE function, which triggers an out-of-bounds read or write.",
      "newValue": "Multiple integer overflow flaws were found in the way the X.Org server calculated memory requirements for certain X11 core protocol requests. A malicious, authenticated client could use either of these flaws to crash the X.Org server or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with root privileges."
