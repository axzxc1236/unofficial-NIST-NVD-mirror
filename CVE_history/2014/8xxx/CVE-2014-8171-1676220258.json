      "oldValue": "It was found that the Linux kernel memory resource controller's (memcg) handling of OOM (out of memory) conditions could lead to deadlocks. An attacker able to continuously spawn new processes within a single memory-constrained cgroup during an OOM event could use this flaw to lock up the system.",
