      "oldValue": "DB_LOOKUP in nss_files/files-XXX.c in the Name Service Switch (NSS) in GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) 2.21 and earlier does not properly check if a file is open, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (infinite loop) by performing a look-up on a database while iterating over it, which triggers the file pointer to be reset.",
      "newValue": "It was found that the files back end of Name Service Switch (NSS) did not isolate iteration over an entire database from key-based look-up API calls. An application performing look-ups on a database while iterating over it could enter an infinite loop, leading to a denial of service."
