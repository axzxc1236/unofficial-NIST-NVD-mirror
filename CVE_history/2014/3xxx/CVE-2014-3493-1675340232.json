      "oldValue": "The push_ascii function in smbd in Samba 3.6.x before 3.6.24, 4.0.x before 4.0.19, and 4.1.x before 4.1.9 allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (memory corruption and daemon crash) via an attempt to read a Unicode pathname without specifying use of Unicode, leading to a character-set conversion failure that triggers an invalid pointer dereference.",
      "newValue": "It was discovered that smbd, the Samba file server daemon, did not properly handle certain files that were stored on the disk and used a valid Unicode character in the file name. An attacker able to send an authenticated non-Unicode request that attempted to read such a file could cause smbd to crash."
