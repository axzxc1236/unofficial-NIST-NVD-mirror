      "oldValue": "It was found that rhevm-log-collector called sosreport with the PostgreSQL database password passed as a command line parameter. A local attacker could read this password by monitoring a process listing. The password would also be written to a log file, which could potentially be read by a local attacker.",
      "newValue": "The rhevm-log-collector package in Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization 3.4 uses the PostgreSQL database password on the command line when calling sosreport, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information by listing the processes."
