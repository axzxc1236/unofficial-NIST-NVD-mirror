      "oldValue": "The oVirt Engine backend module, as used in Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager before 3.4.2, uses an \"insecure DocumentBuilderFactory,\" which allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files or possibly have other unspecified impact via a crafted XML/RSDL document, related to an XML External Entity (XXE) issue.",
      "newValue": "It was discovered that, when loading XML/RSDL documents, the oVirt Engine back end module used an insecure DocumentBuilderFactory. A remote, authenticated attacker could use this flaw to read files accessible to the user running the ovirt-engine server, and potentially perform other more advanced XML External Entity (XXE) attacks."
