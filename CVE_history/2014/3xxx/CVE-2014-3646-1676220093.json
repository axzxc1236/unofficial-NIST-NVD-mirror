      "oldValue": "It was found that the Linux kernel's KVM subsystem did not handle the VM exits gracefully for the invvpid (Invalidate Translations Based on VPID) instructions. On hosts with an Intel processor and invppid VM exit support, an unprivileged guest user could use these instructions to crash the guest.",
      "newValue": "arch/x86/kvm/vmx.c in the KVM subsystem in the Linux kernel through 3.17.2 does not have an exit handler for the INVVPID instruction, which allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service (guest OS crash) via a crafted application."
