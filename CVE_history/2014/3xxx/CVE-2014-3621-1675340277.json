      "oldValue": "The catalog url replacement in OpenStack Identity (Keystone) before 2013.2.3 and 2014.1 before 2014.1.2.1 allows remote authenticated users to read sensitive configuration options via a crafted endpoint, as demonstrated by \"$(admin_token)\" in the publicurl endpoint field.",
      "newValue": "A flaw was found in the keystone catalog URL replacement. A user with permissions to register an endpoint could use this flaw to leak configuration data, including the master admin_token. Only keystone setups that allow non-cloud-admin users to create endpoints were affected by this issue."
