      "type": "Description",
      "oldValue": "api/metadata/handler.py in OpenStack Compute (Nova) before 2013.2.4, 2014.x before 2014.1.2, and Juno before Juno-2, when proxying metadata requests through Neutron, makes it easier for remote attackers to guess instance ID signatures via a brute-force attack that relies on timing differences in responses to instance metadata requests.",
      "newValue": "A side-channel timing attack flaw was found in Nova. An attacker could possibly use this flaw to guess valid instance ID signatures, giving them access to details of another instance, by analyzing the response times of requests for instance metadata. This issue only affected configurations that proxy metadata requests via Neutron."
