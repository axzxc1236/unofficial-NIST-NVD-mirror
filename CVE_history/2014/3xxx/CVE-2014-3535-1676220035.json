      "type": "Description",
      "oldValue": "A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's networking implementation handled logging while processing certain invalid packets coming in via a VxLAN interface. A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash the system by sending a specially crafted packet to such an interface.",
      "newValue": "include/linux/netdevice.h in the Linux kernel before 2.6.36 incorrectly uses macros for netdev_printk and its related logging implementation, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash) by sending invalid packets to a VxLAN interface."
