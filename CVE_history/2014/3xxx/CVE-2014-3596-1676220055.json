      "type": "Description",
      "oldValue": "It was discovered that Axis incorrectly extracted the host name from an X.509 certificate subject's Common Name (CN) field. A man-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw to spoof an SSL server using a specially crafted X.509 certificate.",
      "newValue": "The getCN function in Apache Axis 1.4 and earlier does not properly verify that the server hostname matches a domain name in the subject's Common Name (CN) or subjectAltName field of the X.509 certificate, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof SSL servers via a certificate with a subject that specifies a common name in a field that is not the CN field. NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2012-5784."
