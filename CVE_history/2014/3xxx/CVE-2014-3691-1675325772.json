      "oldValue": "Smart Proxy (aka Smart-Proxy and foreman-proxy) in Foreman before 1.5.4 and 1.6.x before 1.6.2 does not validate SSL certificates, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended authentication and execute arbitrary API requests via a request without a certificate.",
      "newValue": "It was discovered that foreman-proxy, when running in SSL-secured mode, did not correctly verify SSL client certificates. This could permit any client with access to the API to make requests and perform actions otherwise restricted."
