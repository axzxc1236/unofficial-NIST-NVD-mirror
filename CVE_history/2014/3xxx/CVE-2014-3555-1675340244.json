      "type": "Description",
      "oldValue": "OpenStack Neutron before 2013.2.4, 2014.x before 2014.1.2, and Juno before Juno-2 allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (crash or long firewall rule updates) by creating a large number of allowed address pairs.",
      "newValue": "A denial of service flaw was found in neutron's handling of allowed address pairs. As there was no enforced quota on the amount of allowed address pairs, a sufficiently authorized user could possibly create a large number of firewall rules, impacting performance or potentially rendering a compute node unusable."
