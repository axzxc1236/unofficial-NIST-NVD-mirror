      "type": "Description",
      "oldValue": "The Nova EC2 API security group implementation in OpenStack Compute (Nova) 2013.1 before 2013.2.4 and icehouse before icehouse-rc2 does not enforce RBAC policies for (1) add_rules, (2) remove_rules, (3) destroy, and other unspecified methods in compute/api.py when using non-default policies, which allows remote authenticated users to gain privileges via these API requests.",
      "newValue": "It was found that RBAC policies were not enforced in certain methods of the OpenStack Compute EC2 (Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud) API. A remote attacker could use this flaw to escalate their privileges beyond the user group they were originally restricted to. Note that only certain setups using non-default RBAC rules for OpenStack Compute were affected."
