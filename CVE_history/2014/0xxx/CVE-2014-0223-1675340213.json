      "type": "Description",
      "oldValue": "Integer overflow in the qcow_open function in block/qcow.c in QEMU before 1.7.2 allows local users to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a large image size, which triggers a buffer overflow or out-of-bounds read.",
      "newValue": "An integer overflow flaw was found in the QEMU block driver for QCOW version 1 disk images. A user able to alter the QEMU disk image files loaded by a guest could use this flaw to corrupt QEMU process memory on the host, which could potentially result in arbitrary code execution on the host with the privileges of the QEMU process."
