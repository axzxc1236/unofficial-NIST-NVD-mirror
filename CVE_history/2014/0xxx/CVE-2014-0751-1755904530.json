      "newValue": "The CIMPLICITY Web-based access component, CimWebServer, does not check \nthe location of shell files being loaded into the system. By modifying \nthe source location, an attacker could send shell code to the \nCimWebServer which would deploy the nefarious files as part of any SCADA\n project. This could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code."
