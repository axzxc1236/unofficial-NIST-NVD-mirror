      "action": "Changed",
      "type": "Description",
      "oldValue": "It was discovered that yum-updatesd did not properly perform RPM package signature checks. When yum-updatesd was configured to automatically install updates, a remote attacker could use this flaw to install a malicious update on the target system using an unsigned RPM or an RPM signed with an untrusted key.",
      "newValue": "The installUpdates function in yum-cron/yum-cron.py in yum 3.4.3 and earlier does not properly check the return value of the sigCheckPkg function, which allows remote attackers to bypass the RMP package signing restriction via an unsigned package."
