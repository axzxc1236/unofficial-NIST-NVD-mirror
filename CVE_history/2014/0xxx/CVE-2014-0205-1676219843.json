      "action": "Changed",
      "type": "Description",
      "oldValue": "A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's futex subsystem handled reference counting when requeuing futexes during futex_wait(). A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to zero out the reference counter of an inode or an mm struct that backs up the memory area of the futex, which could lead to a use-after-free flaw, resulting in a system crash or, potentially, privilege escalation.",
      "newValue": "The futex_wait function in kernel/futex.c in the Linux kernel before 2.6.37 does not properly maintain a certain reference count during requeue operations, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (use-after-free and system crash) or possibly gain privileges via a crafted application that triggers a zero count."
