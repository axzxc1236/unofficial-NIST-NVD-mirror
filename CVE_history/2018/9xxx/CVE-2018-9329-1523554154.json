      "oldValue": "** DISPUTED ** The Bitdefender Antivirus 6.2.19.890 component, as configured for AV Defender in SolarWinds N-Central and possibly other products, attempts to access hosts in the bitdefeder.net Potentially Unwanted Domain (a domain similar to \"bitdefender.net\" but with a missing 'n' character) in unspecified circumstances. The observed hostnames are of the form upgr-midgress-##.htz.bitdefeder.net; however, all hostnames ending in .bitdefeder.net apparently resolve to the same IP address. This product behavior may allow remote attackers to block antivirus updates or potentially provide crafted updates, either by controlling that IP address or by purchasing the bitdefeder.net domain name. NOTE: the vendor reportedly disputes the details of this finding, indicating that a user's tools may have displayed upgr-midgress-##.htz.bitdefeder.net names because of incorrect DNS PTR records, not actual outbound traffic to an unintended IP address.",
      "newValue": "** REJECT **  DO NOT USE THIS CANDIDATE NUMBER.  ConsultIDs: none.  Reason: This candidate was withdrawn by its CNA.  Further investigation showed that it was not a security issue.  Notes: none."
