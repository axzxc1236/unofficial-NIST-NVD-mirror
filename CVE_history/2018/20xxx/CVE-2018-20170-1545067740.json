      "oldValue": "** DISPUTED ** OpenStack Keystone through 14.0.1 has a user enumeration vulnerability because invalid usernames have much faster responses than valid ones for a POST /v3/auth/tokens request. NOTE: the vendor feels that the benefit to changing this might be too small relative to the performance degradation.",

NOTE: the vendor's position is that this is a hardening opportunity, and not necessarily an issue that should have an OpenStack Security Advisory."
