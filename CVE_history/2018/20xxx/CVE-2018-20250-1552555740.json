      "oldValue": "By crafting the filename field of the ACE format, the destination folder (extraction folder) is ignored, and the relative path in the filename field becomes an absolute Path. This logical bug, allows the extraction of a file to an arbitrary location which is effectively code execution.",
      "newValue": "In WinRAR versions prior to and including 5.61, There is path traversal vulnerability when crafting the filename field of the ACE format (in UNACEV2.dll). When the filename field is manipulated with specific patterns, the destination (extraction) folder is ignored, thus treating the filename as an absolute path."
