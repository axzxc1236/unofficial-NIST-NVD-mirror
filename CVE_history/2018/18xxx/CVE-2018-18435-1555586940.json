      "type": "Description",
      "oldValue": "KioWare Server 4.9.6 allows local users to gain privileges by replacing \\kioware_com\\KWSS.exe with a Trojan horse program, because \\kioware_com has \"Everyone: (F)\" permissions.",
      "newValue": "KioWare Server version 4.9.6 and older installs by default to \"C:\\kioware_com\" with weak folder permissions granting any user full permission \"Everyone: (F)\" to the contents of the directory and it's sub-folders. In addition, the program installs a service called \"KWSService\" which runs as \"Localsystem\", this will allow any user to escalate privileges to \"NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM\" by substituting the service's binary with a malicious one."
