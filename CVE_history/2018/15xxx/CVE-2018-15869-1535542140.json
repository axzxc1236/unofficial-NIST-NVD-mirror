    {
      "action": "Changed",
      "type": "Description",
      "oldValue": "The Amazon Web Services (AWS) CLI version 1.15.85 (and possibly earlier versions) does not require the --owners flag when describing images, which makes it easier for remote attackers to trigger the loading of an undesired AMI by setting similar image properties (i.e., name), as exploited in the wild during August 2018 with a Monero miner AMI instead of the expected Ubuntu AMI.",
      "newValue": "An Amazon Web Services (AWS) developer who does not specify the --owners flag when describing images via AWS CLI, and therefore not properly validating source software per AWS recommended security best practices, may unintentionally load an undesired and potentially malicious Amazon Machine Image (AMI) from the uncurated public community AMI catalog."
