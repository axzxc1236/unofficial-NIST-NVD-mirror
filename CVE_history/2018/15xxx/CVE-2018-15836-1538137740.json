      "type": "Description",
      "oldValue": "In Openswan before 2.6.50.1, IKEv2 signature verification is vulnerable to \"Variants of Bleichenbacher's Low-Exponent Attack on PKCS#1 RSA Signatures\" attacks when RAW RSA keys are used.",
      "newValue": "In verify_signed_hash() in lib/liboswkeys/signatures.c in Openswan before 2.6.50.1, the RSA implementation does not verify the value of padding string during PKCS#1 v1.5 signature verification. Consequently, a remote attacker can forge signatures when small public exponents are being used. IKEv2 signature verification is affected when RAW RSA keys are used."
