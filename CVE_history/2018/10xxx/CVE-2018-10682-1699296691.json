It is possible for an attacker to access the administration panel on TCP port 9990 without any authentication using \"anonymous\" access that is automatically created. Once logged in, a misconfiguration present by default (auto-deployment) permits an anonymous user to deploy a malicious .war file, leading to remote code execution. NOTE: the vendor indicates that anonymous access is not available in the default installation; however, it remains optional because there are several use cases for it, including development environments and network architectures that have a proxy server for access control to the WildFly server.",
