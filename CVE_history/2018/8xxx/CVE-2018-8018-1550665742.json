      "oldValue": "In Apache Ignite before 2.4.8 and 2.5.x before 2.5.3, the serialization  mechanism does not have a list of classes allowed for  serialization/deserialization, which makes it possible to run arbitrary  code when 3-rd party vulnerable classes are present in Ignite classpath.  The vulnerability can be exploited if the one sends a specially prepared  form of a serialized object to GridClientJdkMarshaller deserialization  endpoint.",
