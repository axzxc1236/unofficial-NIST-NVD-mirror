      "oldValue": "Apache Ignite 2.5 and earlier serialization mechanism does not have a list of classes allowed for serialization/deserialization, which makes it possible to run arbitrary code when 3-rd party vulnerable classes are present in Ignite classpath. The vulnerability can be exploited if the one sends a specially prepared form of a serialized object to GridClientJdkMarshaller deserialization endpoint.",

The vulnerability can be exploited if the one sends a specially prepared  form of a serialized object to GridClientJdkMarshaller deserialization  endpoint."
