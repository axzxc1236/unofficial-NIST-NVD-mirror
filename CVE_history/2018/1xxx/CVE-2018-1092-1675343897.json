      "oldValue": "The ext4_iget function in fs/ext4/inode.c in the Linux kernel through 4.15.15 mishandles the case of a root directory with a zero i_links_count, which allows attackers to cause a denial of service (ext4_process_freed_data NULL pointer dereference and OOPS) via a crafted ext4 image.",
      "newValue": "The Linux kernel is vulnerable to a NULL pointer dereference in the ext4/mballoc.c:ext4_process_freed_data() function. An attacker could trick a legitimate user or a privileged attacker could exploit this by mounting a crafted ext4 image to cause a kernel panic."
