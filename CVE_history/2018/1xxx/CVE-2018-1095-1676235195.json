      "action": "Changed",
      "type": "Description",
      "oldValue": "The Linux kernel is vulnerable to an out-of-bound access bug in the fs/posix_acl.c:get_acl() function. An attacker could trick a legitimate user or a privileged attacker could exploit this to cause a system crash or other unspecified impact with a crafted ext4 image. Due to the nature of the flaw, privilege escalation cannot be fully ruled out, although we believe it is unlikely.",
      "newValue": "The ext4_xattr_check_entries function in fs/ext4/xattr.c in the Linux kernel through 4.15.15 does not properly validate xattr sizes, which causes misinterpretation of a size as an error code, and consequently allows attackers to cause a denial of service (get_acl NULL pointer dereference and system crash) via a crafted ext4 image."
