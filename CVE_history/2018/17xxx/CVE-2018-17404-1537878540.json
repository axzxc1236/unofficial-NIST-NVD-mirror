      "newValue": "** DISPUTED ** The SBIbuddy (aka com.sbi.erupee) application 1.41 and 1.42 for Android might allow an attacker to sniff private information such as mobile number, PAN number (from a government-issued ID), and date of birth.  NOTE: a third-party says that, to exploit this, the user has to explicitly install a malicious app and provide accessibility permission to the malicious app, that the Android platform provides fair warnings to the users before turning on accessibility for any application, and that it believes it is similar to installing malicious keyboards, or malicious apps taking screenshots."
