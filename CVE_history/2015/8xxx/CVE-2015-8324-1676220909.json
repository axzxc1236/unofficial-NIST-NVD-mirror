      "oldValue": "A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's ext4 file system driver handled certain corrupted file system images. An attacker with physical access to the system could use this flaw to crash the system.",
      "newValue": "The ext4 implementation in the Linux kernel before 2.6.34 does not properly track the initialization of certain data structures, which allows physically proximate attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and panic) via a crafted USB device, related to the ext4_fill_super function."
