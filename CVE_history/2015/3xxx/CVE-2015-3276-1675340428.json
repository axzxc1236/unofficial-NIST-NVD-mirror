      "oldValue": "The nss_parse_ciphers function in libraries/libldap/tls_m.c in OpenLDAP does not properly parse OpenSSL-style multi-keyword mode cipher strings, which might cause a weaker than intended cipher to be used and allow remote attackers to have unspecified impact via unknown vectors.",
