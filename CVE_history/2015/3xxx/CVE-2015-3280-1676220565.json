      "type": "Description",
      "oldValue": "A flaw was found in the way OpenStack Compute (nova) handled the resize state. If an authenticated user deleted an instance while it was in the resize state, it could cause the original instance to not be deleted from the compute node it was running on, allowing the user to cause a denial of service.",
      "newValue": "OpenStack Compute (nova) before 2014.2.4 (juno) and 2015.1.x before 2015.1.2 (kilo) does not properly delete instances from compute nodes, which allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (disk consumption) by deleting instances while in the resize state."
