      "oldValue": "Heap-based buffer overflow in the PCNET controller in QEMU allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by sending a packet with TXSTATUS_STARTPACKET set and then a crafted packet with TXSTATUS_DEVICEOWNS set.",
      "newValue": "A flaw was found in the way QEMU's AMD PCnet Ethernet emulation handled multi-TMD packets with a length above 4096 bytes. A privileged guest user in a guest with an AMD PCNet ethernet card enabled could potentially use this flaw to execute arbitrary code on the host with the privileges of the hosting QEMU process."
