      "oldValue": "It was found that the \"/var/lib/openhpi\" directory provided by OpenHPI used world-writeable and world-readable permissions. A local user could use this flaw to view, modify, and delete OpenHPI-related data, or even fill up the storage device hosting the /var/lib directory.",
      "newValue": "openhpi/Makefile.am in OpenHPI before 3.6.0 uses world-writable permissions for /var/lib/openhpi directory, which allows local users, when quotas are not properly setup, to fill the filesystem hosting /var/lib and cause a denial of service (disk consumption)."
