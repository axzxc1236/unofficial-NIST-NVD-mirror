      "type": "Description",
      "oldValue": "ntp-keygen in ntp 4.2.8px before 4.2.8p2-RC2 and 4.3.x before 4.3.12 does not generate MD5 keys with sufficient entropy on big endian machines when the lowest order byte of the temp variable is between 0x20 and 0x7f and not #, which might allow remote attackers to obtain the value of generated MD5 keys via a brute force attack with the 93 possible keys.",
      "newValue": "A flaw was found in the way the ntp-keygen utility generated MD5 symmetric keys on big-endian systems. An attacker could possibly use this flaw to guess generated MD5 keys, which could then be used to spoof an NTP client or server."
