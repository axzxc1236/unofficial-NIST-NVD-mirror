      "oldValue": "Incomplete blacklist vulnerability in the chfn function in libuser before 0.56.13-8 and 0.60 before 0.60-7, as used in the userhelper program in the usermode package, allows local users to cause a denial of service (/etc/passwd corruption) via a newline character in the GECOS field.",
      "newValue": "It was found that libuser, as used by the chfn userhelper functionality, did not properly filter out newline characters in GECOS fields. A local, authenticated user could use this flaw to corrupt the /etc/passwd file, resulting in a denial-of-service on the system."
