      "oldValue": "Race condition in the worker_update_monitors_config function in SPICE 0.12.4 allows a remote authenticated guest user to cause a denial of service (heap-based memory corruption and QEMU-KVM crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code on the host via unspecified vectors.",
      "newValue": "A race condition flaw, leading to a heap-based memory corruption, was found in spice's worker_update_monitors_config() function, which runs under the QEMU-KVM context on the host. A user in a guest could leverage this flaw to crash the host QEMU-KVM process or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the host QEMU-KVM process."
