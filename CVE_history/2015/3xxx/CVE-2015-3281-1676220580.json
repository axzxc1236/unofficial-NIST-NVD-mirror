      "oldValue": "An implementation error related to the memory management of request and responses was found within HAProxy's buffer_slow_realign() function. An unauthenticated remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to leak certain memory buffer contents from a past request or session.",
      "newValue": "The buffer_slow_realign function in HAProxy 1.5.x before 1.5.14 and 1.6-dev does not properly realign a buffer that is used for pending outgoing data, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information (uninitialized memory contents of previous requests) via a crafted request."
