      "oldValue": "The _unix_run_helper_binary function in the pam_unix module in Linux-PAM (aka pam) before 1.2.1, when unable to directly access passwords, allows local users to enumerate usernames or cause a denial of service (hang) via a large password.",
      "newValue": "It was discovered that the _unix_run_helper_binary() function of PAM's unix_pam module could write to a blocking pipe, possibly causing the function to become unresponsive. An attacker able to supply large passwords to the unix_pam module could use this flaw to enumerate valid user accounts, or cause a denial of service on the system."
