      "type": "Description",
      "oldValue": "It was discovered that the kernel-invoked coredump processor provided by ABRT wrote core dumps to files owned by other system users. This could result in information disclosure if an application crashed while its current directory was a directory writable to by other users (such as /tmp).",
      "newValue": "The kernel-invoked coredump processor in Automatic Bug Reporting Tool (ABRT) does not properly check the ownership of files before writing core dumps to them, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information by leveraging write permissions to the working directory of a crashed application."
