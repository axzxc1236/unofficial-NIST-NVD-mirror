      "oldValue": "It was discovered that the puppet manifests, as provided with the openstack-puppet-modules package, would configure the pcsd daemon with a known default password. If this password was not changed and an attacker was able to gain access to pcsd, they could potentially run shell commands as root.",
      "newValue": "The puppet manifests in the Red Hat openstack-puppet-modules package before 2014.2.13-2 uses a default password of CHANGEME for the pcsd daemon, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary shell commands via unspecified vectors."
