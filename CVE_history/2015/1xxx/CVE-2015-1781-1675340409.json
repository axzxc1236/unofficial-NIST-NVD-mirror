      "type": "Description",
      "oldValue": "Buffer overflow in the gethostbyname_r and other unspecified NSS functions in the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) before 2.22 allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) or execute arbitrary code via a crafted DNS response, which triggers a call with a misaligned buffer.",
      "newValue": "A buffer overflow flaw was found in the way glibc's gethostbyname_r() and other related functions computed the size of a buffer when passed a misaligned buffer as input. An attacker able to make an application call any of these functions with a misaligned buffer could use this flaw to crash the application or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the user running the application."
