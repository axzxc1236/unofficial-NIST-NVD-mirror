      "oldValue": "It was found that the pcs daemon did not sign cookies containing session data that were sent to clients connecting via the pcsd web UI. A remote attacker could use this flaw to forge cookies and bypass authorization checks, possibly gaining elevated privileges in the pcsd web UI.",
      "newValue": "The pcs daemon (pcsd) in PCS 0.9.137 and earlier does not set the secure flag for a cookie in an https session, which makes it easier for remote attackers to capture this cookie by intercepting its transmission within an http session. NOTE: this issue was SPLIT per ADT2 due to different vulnerability types. CVE-2015-3983 is for the issue with not setting the HTTPOnly flag."
