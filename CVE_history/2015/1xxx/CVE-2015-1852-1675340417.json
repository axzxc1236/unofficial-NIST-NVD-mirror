      "action": "Changed",
      "type": "Description",
      "oldValue": "The s3_token middleware in OpenStack keystonemiddleware before 1.6.0 and python-keystoneclient before 1.4.0 disables certification verification when the \"insecure\" option is set in a paste configuration (paste.ini) file regardless of the value, which allows remote attackers to conduct man-in-the-middle attacks via a crafted certificate, a different vulnerability than CVE-2014-7144.",
      "newValue": "It was discovered that some items in the S3Token paste configuration as used by python-keystonemiddleware (formerly python-keystoneclient) were incorrectly evaluated as strings, an issue similar to CVE-2014-7144. If the \"insecure\" option were set to \"false\", the option would be evaluated as true, resulting in TLS connections being vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks. Note: the \"insecure\" option defaults to false, so setups that do not specifically define \"insecure=false\" are not affected."
