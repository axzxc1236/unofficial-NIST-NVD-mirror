      "type": "Description",
      "oldValue": "A denial of service flaw was found in the way OpenSSL verified certain signed messages using CMS (Cryptographic Message Syntax). A remote attacker could cause an application using OpenSSL to use excessive amounts of memory by sending a specially crafted message for verification.",
      "newValue": "The do_free_upto function in crypto/cms/cms_smime.c in OpenSSL before 0.9.8zg, 1.0.0 before 1.0.0s, 1.0.1 before 1.0.1n, and 1.0.2 before 1.0.2b allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (infinite loop) via vectors that trigger a NULL value of a BIO data structure, as demonstrated by an unrecognized X.660 OID for a hash function."
