      "type": "Description",
      "oldValue": "The VNC websocket frame decoder in QEMU allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory and CPU consumption) via a large (1) websocket payload or (2) HTTP headers section.",
      "newValue": "It was found that the QEMU's websocket frame decoder processed incoming frames without limiting resources used to process the header and the payload. An attacker able to access a guest's VNC console could use this flaw to trigger a denial of service on the host by exhausting all available memory and CPU."
