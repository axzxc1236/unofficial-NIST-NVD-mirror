      "oldValue": "An out-of-bounds read flaw was found in the X509_cmp_time() function of OpenSSL, which is used to test the expiry dates of SSL/TLS certificates. An attacker could possibly use a specially crafted SSL/TLS certificate or CRL (Certificate Revocation List), which when parsed by an application would cause that application to crash.",
      "newValue": "The X509_cmp_time function in crypto/x509/x509_vfy.c in OpenSSL before 0.9.8zg, 1.0.0 before 1.0.0s, 1.0.1 before 1.0.1n, and 1.0.2 before 1.0.2b allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read and application crash) via a crafted length field in ASN1_TIME data, as demonstrated by an attack against a server that supports client authentication with a custom verification callback."
