      "newValue": "The get_user_grouplist function in the extdom plug-in in FreeIPA before 4.1.4 does not properly reallocate memory when processing user accounts, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a group list request for a user that belongs to a large number of groups."
