      "oldValue": "An uninitialized pointer use flaw was found when allocating memory to save unacknowledged replies to authenticated command requests. An attacker that has the command key and is allowed to access cmdmon (only localhost is allowed by default) could use this flaw to crash chronyd or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the chronyd process.",
      "newValue": "chrony before 1.31.1 does not initialize the last \"next\" pointer when saving unacknowledged replies to command requests, which allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (uninitialized pointer dereference and daemon crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a large number of command requests."
