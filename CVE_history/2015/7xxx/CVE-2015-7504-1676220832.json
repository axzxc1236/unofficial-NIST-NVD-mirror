      "oldValue": "A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was discovered in the way QEMU's AMD PC-Net II Ethernet Controller emulation received certain packets in loopback mode. A privileged user (with the CAP_SYS_RAWIO capability) inside a guest could use this flaw to crash the host QEMU process (resulting in denial of service) or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with privileges of the host QEMU process.",
      "newValue": "Heap-based buffer overflow in the pcnet_receive function in hw/net/pcnet.c in QEMU allows guest OS administrators to cause a denial of service (instance crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a series of packets in loopback mode."
