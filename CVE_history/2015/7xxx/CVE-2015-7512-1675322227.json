      "type": "Description",
      "oldValue": "Buffer overflow in the pcnet_receive function in hw/net/pcnet.c in QEMU, when a guest NIC has a larger MTU, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (guest OS crash) or execute arbitrary code via a large packet.",
      "newValue": "A buffer overflow flaw was found in the way QEMU's AMD PC-Net II emulation validated certain received packets from a remote host in non-loopback mode. A remote, unprivileged attacker could potentially use this flaw to execute arbitrary code on the host with the privileges of the QEMU process. Note that to exploit this flaw, the guest network interface must have a large MTU limit."
