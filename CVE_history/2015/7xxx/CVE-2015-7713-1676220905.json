      "oldValue": "A vulnerability was discovered in the way OpenStack Compute (nova) networking handled security group updates; changes were not applied to already running VM instances. A remote attacker could use this flaw to access running VM instances.",
      "newValue": "OpenStack Compute (Nova) before 2014.2.4 (juno) and 2015.1.x before 2015.1.2 (kilo) do not properly apply security group changes, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended restriction by leveraging an instance that was running when the change was made."
