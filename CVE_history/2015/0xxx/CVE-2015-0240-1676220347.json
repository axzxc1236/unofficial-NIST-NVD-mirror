      "oldValue": "An uninitialized pointer use flaw was found in the Samba daemon (smbd). A malicious Samba client could send specially crafted netlogon packets that, when processed by smbd, could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running smbd (by default, the root user).",
      "newValue": "The Netlogon server implementation in smbd in Samba 3.5.x and 3.6.x before 3.6.25, 4.0.x before 4.0.25, 4.1.x before 4.1.17, and 4.2.x before 4.2.0rc5 performs a free operation on an uninitialized stack pointer, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via crafted Netlogon packets that use the ServerPasswordSet RPC API, as demonstrated by packets reaching the _netr_ServerPasswordSet function in rpc_server/netlogon/srv_netlog_nt.c."
