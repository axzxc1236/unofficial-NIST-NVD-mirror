      "oldValue": "It was discovered that the OpenStack Compute (nova) console websocket did not correctly verify the origin header. An attacker could use this flaw to conduct a cross-site websocket hijack attack. Note that only Compute setups with VNC or SPICE enabled were affected by this flaw.",
      "newValue": "OpenStack Compute (Nova) before 2014.1.4, 2014.2.x before 2014.2.3, and kilo before kilo-3 does not validate the origin of websocket requests, which allows remote attackers to hijack the authentication of users for access to consoles via a crafted webpage."
