      "newValue": "It was found that ABRT may have exposed non-public information to Red Hat Bugzilla during crash reporting. A bug in the libreport library caused changes made by a user in files included in a crash report to be discarded. As a result, Red Hat Bugzilla attachments may contain data that was not intended to be made public, including host names, IP addresses, or command line options."
