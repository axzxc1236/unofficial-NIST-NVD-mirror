      "oldValue": "A heap-based buffer overflow issue was found in the QEMU emulator's VNC display driver. It could occur while refreshing the VNC server's display surface using the vnc_refresh_server_surface() routine. A privileged guest user could use this flaw to corrupt the heap memory and crash the QEMU process instance, or to potentially use it to execute arbitrary code on the host.",
      "newValue": "Buffer overflow in the vnc_refresh_server_surface function in the VNC display driver in QEMU before 2.4.0.1 allows guest users to cause a denial of service (heap memory corruption and process crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code on the host via unspecified vectors, related to refreshing the server display surface."
