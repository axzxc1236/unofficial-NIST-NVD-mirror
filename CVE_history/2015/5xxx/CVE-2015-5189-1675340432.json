      "oldValue": "Race condition in pcsd in PCS 0.9.139 and earlier uses a global variable to validate usernames, which allows remote authenticated users to gain privileges by sending a command that is checked for security after another user is authenticated.",

An attacker could use this flaw to send a request that would be evaluated as originating from a different user, potentially allowing the attacker to perform actions with permissions of a more privileged user."
