      "type": "Description",
      "oldValue": "A heap buffer overflow flaw was found in the way QEMU's IDE subsystem handled I/O buffer access while processing certain ATAPI commands. A privileged guest user in a guest with the CDROM drive enabled could potentially use this flaw to execute arbitrary code on the host with the privileges of the host's QEMU process corresponding to the guest.",
      "newValue": "Heap-based buffer overflow in the IDE subsystem in QEMU, as used in Xen 4.5.x and earlier, when the container has a CDROM drive enabled, allows local guest users to execute arbitrary code on the host via unspecified ATAPI commands."
