      "type": "Description",
      "oldValue": "A resource vulnerability in the OpenStack Compute (nova), Block Storage (cinder), and Image (glance) services was found in their use of qemu-img. An unprivileged user could consume as much as 4 GB of RAM on the compute host by uploading a malicious image. This flaw could lead possibly to host out-of-memory errors and negatively affect other running tenant instances. oslo.concurrency has been updated to support process limits ('prlimit'), which is needed to fix this flaw.",
      "newValue": "The image parser in OpenStack Cinder 7.0.2 and 8.0.0 through 8.1.1; Glance before 11.0.1 and 12.0.0; and Nova before 12.0.4 and 13.0.0 does not properly limit qemu-img calls, which might allow attackers to cause a denial of service (memory and disk consumption) via a crafted disk image."
