      "oldValue": "It was discovered that the EAP Management Console could be opened in an IFRAME, which made it possible to intercept and manipulate requests. An attacker could use this flaw to trick a user into performing arbitrary actions in the Console (clickjacking).",
      "newValue": "The Management Console in Red Hat Enterprise Application Platform before 6.4.4 and WildFly (formerly JBoss Application Server) does not send an X-Frame-Options HTTP header, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct clickjacking attacks via a crafted web page that contains a (1) FRAME or (2) IFRAME element."
