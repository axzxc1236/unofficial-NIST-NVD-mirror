      "oldValue": "A race-condition flaw was discovered in the OpenStack Image service (glance). When images in the upload state were deleted using a token close to expiration, untracked image data could accumulate in the back end. Because untracked data does not count towards the storage quota, an attacker could use this flaw to cause a denial of service through resource exhaustion.",
      "newValue": "OpenStack Image Service (Glance) before 2014.2.4 (juno) and 2015.1.x before 2015.1.2 (kilo) allows remote authenticated users to bypass the storage quota and cause a denial of service (disk consumption) by deleting images that are being uploaded using a token that expires during the process. NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2014-9623."
