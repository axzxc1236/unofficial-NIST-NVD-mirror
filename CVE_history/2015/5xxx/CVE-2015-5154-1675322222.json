      "oldValue": "Heap-based buffer overflow in the IDE subsystem in QEMU, as used in Xen 4.5.x and earlier, when the container has a CDROM drive enabled, allows local guest users to execute arbitrary code on the host via unspecified ATAPI commands.",
      "newValue": "A heap buffer overflow flaw was found in the way QEMU's IDE subsystem handled I/O buffer access while processing certain ATAPI commands. A privileged guest user in a guest with the CDROM drive enabled could potentially use this flaw to execute arbitrary code on the host with the privileges of the host's QEMU process corresponding to the guest."
