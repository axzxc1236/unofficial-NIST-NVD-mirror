      "oldValue": "OpenStack Ironic Inspector (aka ironic-inspector or ironic-discoverd), when debug mode is enabled, might allow remote attackers to access the Flask console and execute arbitrary Python code by triggering an error.",
      "newValue": "It was discovered that enabling debug mode in openstack-ironic-discoverd also enabled debug mode in the underlying Flask framework. If errors were encountered while Flask was in debug mode, a user experiencing an error might be able to access the debug console (effectively, a command shell)."
