      "newValue": "The Generate PDF using Contact Form 7 plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery to Arbitrary File Upload in versions up to, and including, 4.0.6. This is due to missing nonce validation and missing file type validation in the 'wp_cf7_pdf_dashboard_html_page' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link."
