      "newValue": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ngpiolib: Fix potential NULL pointer dereference in gpiod_get_label()\n\nIn `gpiod_get_label()`, it is possible that `srcu_dereference_check()` may\nreturn a NULL pointer, leading to a scenario where `label->str` is accessed\nwithout verifying if `label` itself is NULL.\n\nThis patch adds a proper NULL check for `label` before accessing\n`label->str`. The check for `label->str != NULL` is removed because\n`label->str` can never be NULL if `label` is not NULL.\n\nThis fixes the issue where the label name was being printed as `(efault)`\nwhen dumping the sysfs GPIO file when `label == NULL`."
