      "oldValue": "The goTenna Pro series does not use SecureRandom when generating its cryptographic keys. The random function in use is not suitable for cryptographic use.",
      "newValue": "The goTenna Pro App does not use SecureRandom when generating passwords \nfor sharing cryptographic keys. The random function in use makes it \neasier for attackers to brute force this password if the broadcasted \nencryption key is captured over RF. This only applies to the optional \nbroadcast of an encryption key, so it is advised to share the key with \nlocal QR code for higher security operations."
