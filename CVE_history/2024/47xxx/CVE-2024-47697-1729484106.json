      "newValue": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrivers: media: dvb-frontends/rtl2830: fix an out-of-bounds write error\n\nEnsure index in rtl2830_pid_filter does not exceed 31 to prevent\nout-of-bounds access.\n\ndev->filters is a 32-bit value, so set_bit and clear_bit functions should\nonly operate on indices from 0 to 31. If index is 32, it will attempt to\naccess a non-existent 33rd bit, leading to out-of-bounds access.\nChange the boundary check from index > 32 to index >= 32 to resolve this\nissue."
