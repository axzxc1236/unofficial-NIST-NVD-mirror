Versions of Filament from v3.0.0 through v3.2.114 are affected by a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. If values passed to a `ColorColumn` or `ColumnEntry` are not valid and contain a specific set of characters, applications are vulnerable to XSS attack against a user who opens a page on which a color column or entry is rendered. Filament v3.2.115 fixes this issue."
