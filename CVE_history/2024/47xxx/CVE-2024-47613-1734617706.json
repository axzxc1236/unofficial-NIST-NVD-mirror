      "oldValue": "GStreamer is a library for constructing graphs of media-handling components. A stack-buffer overflow has been detected in the vorbis_handle_identification_packet function within gstvorbisdec.c. The position array is a stack-allocated buffer of size 64. If vd->vi.channels exceeds 64, the for loop will write beyond the boundaries of the position array. The value written will always be GST_AUDIO_CHANNEL_POSITION_NONE. This vulnerability allows to overwrite the EIP address allocated in the stack. Additionally, this bug can overwrite the GstAudioInfo info structure. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.24.10.",
      "newValue": "GStreamer is a library for constructing graphs of media-handling components. A null pointer dereference vulnerability has been identified in `gst_gdk_pixbuf_dec_flush` within `gstgdkpixbufdec.c`. This function invokes `memcpy`, using `out_pix` as the destination address. `out_pix` is expected to point to the frame 0 from the frame structure, which is read from the input file. However, in certain situations, it can points to a NULL frame, causing the subsequent call to `memcpy` to attempt writing to the null address (0x00), leading to a null pointer dereference. This vulnerability can result in a Denial of Service (DoS) by triggering a segmentation fault (SEGV). This vulnerability is fixed in 1.24.10."
