      "newValue": "Adobe Connect versions 12.6, 11.4.7 and earlier are affected by a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. If an attacker is able to convince a victim to visit a URL referencing a vulnerable page, malicious JavaScript content may be executed within the context of the victim's browser. A successful attacker can abuse this to achieve session takeover, increasing the confidentiality and integrity impact as high. This attack is dependent on the victim opening the malicious URL with a specific browser, increasing the attack complexity."
