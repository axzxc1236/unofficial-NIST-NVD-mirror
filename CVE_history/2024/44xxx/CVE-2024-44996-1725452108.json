      "newValue": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nvsock: fix recursive ->recvmsg calls\n\nAfter a vsock socket has been added to a BPF sockmap, its prot->recvmsg\nhas been replaced with vsock_bpf_recvmsg(). Thus the following\nrecursiion could happen:\n\nvsock_bpf_recvmsg()\n -> __vsock_recvmsg()\n  -> vsock_connectible_recvmsg()\n   -> prot->recvmsg()\n    -> vsock_bpf_recvmsg() again\n\nWe need to fix it by calling the original ->recvmsg() without any BPF\nsockmap logic in __vsock_recvmsg()."
