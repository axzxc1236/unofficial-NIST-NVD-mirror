      "newValue": "Mintplex-Labs' anything-llm application is vulnerable to improper neutralization of special elements used in an expression language statement, identified in the commit id `57984fa85c31988b2eff429adfc654c46e0c342a`. The vulnerability arises from the application's handling of user modifications by managers or admins, allowing for the modification of all existing attributes of the `user` database entity without proper checks or sanitization. This flaw can be exploited to delete user threads, denying users access to their previously submitted data, or to inject fake threads and/or chat history for social engineering attacks."
