      "newValue": "An issue was discovered in Appsmith before 1.51. A user on Appsmith that doesn't have admin permissions can trigger the restart API on Appsmith, causing a server restart. This is still within the Appsmith container, and the impact is limited to Appsmith's own server only, but there is a denial of service because it can be continually restarted. This is due to incorrect access control checks, which should check for super user permissions on the incoming request."
