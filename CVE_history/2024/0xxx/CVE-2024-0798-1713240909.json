    {
      "action": "Changed",
      "type": "Description",
      "oldValue": "A user with a `default` role given to them by the admin can sent `DELETE` HTTP requests to `remove-folder` and `remove-document` to delete folders and source files from the instance even when their role should explicitly not allow this action on the system.",
      "newValue": "A privilege escalation vulnerability exists in mintplex-labs/anything-llm, allowing users with 'default' role to delete documents uploaded by 'admin'. Despite the intended restriction that prevents 'default' role users from deleting admin-uploaded documents, an attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted DELETE request to the /api/system/remove-document endpoint. This vulnerability is due to improper access control checks, enabling unauthorized document deletion and potentially leading to loss of data integrity."
