      "newValue": "The FileBird plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via imported folder titles in all versions up to, and including, 5.5.8.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator access, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. It may also be possible to socially engineer an administrator into uploading a malicious folder import."
