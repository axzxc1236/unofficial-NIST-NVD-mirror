This vulnerability affects unknown code of the file /api/files/recipepictures/ of the component SVG File Upload Handler.

The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The real existence of this vulnerability is still doubted at the moment. NOTE: The project maintainer explains that \"this is 'nonsense' and practically irrelevant according to the project's security policy\" which expects additional authentication for the software.",

Unfortunately, the project maintainer does not want to be quoted in any way regarding the dispute rationale. The security policy of the project implies that this finding is \"practically irrelevant\" due to authentication requirements."
