      "newValue": "A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary version git f07a845. The server uses the regex /{.*?}/ to match user-controlled strings. In the default JavaScript regex engine, this regex can take polynomial time to match certain crafted user inputs. As a result, an attacker can cause the server to hang for an arbitrary amount of time by submitting a specially crafted payload. This issue is fixed in version 1.4.26."
