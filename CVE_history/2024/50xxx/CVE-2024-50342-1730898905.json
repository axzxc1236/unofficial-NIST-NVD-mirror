      "newValue": "symfony/http-client is a module for the Symphony PHP framework which provides powerful methods to fetch HTTP resources synchronously or asynchronously. When using the `NoPrivateNetworkHttpClient`, some internal information is still leaking during host resolution, which leads to possible IP/port enumeration. As of versions 5.4.46, 6.4.14, and 7.1.7 the `NoPrivateNetworkHttpClient` now filters blocked IPs earlier to prevent such leaks. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."
