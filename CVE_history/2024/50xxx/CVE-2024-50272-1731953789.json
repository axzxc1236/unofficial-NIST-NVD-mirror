      "newValue": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nfilemap: Fix bounds checking in filemap_read()\n\nIf the caller supplies an iocb->ki_pos value that is close to the\nfilesystem upper limit, and an iterator with a count that causes us to\noverflow that limit, then filemap_read() enters an infinite loop.\n\nThis behaviour was discovered when testing xfstests generic/525 with the\n\"localio\" optimisation for loopback NFS mounts."
