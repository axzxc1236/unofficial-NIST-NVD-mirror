      "newValue": "A stored XSS issue was discovered in Archer Platform 6.8 before 2024.06. A remote authenticated malicious Archer user could potentially exploit this to store malicious HTML or JavaScript code in a trusted application data store. When victim users access the data store through their browsers, the malicious code gets executed by the web browser in the context of the vulnerable application. 6.14.P4 (6.14.0.4) and 6.13 P4 (6.13.0.4) are also fixed releases. This vulnerability is similar to, but not identical to, CVE-2023-30639."
