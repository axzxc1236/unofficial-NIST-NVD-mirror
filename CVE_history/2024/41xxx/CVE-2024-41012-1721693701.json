      "type": "Description",
      "newValue": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nfilelock: Remove locks reliably when fcntl/close race is detected\n\nWhen fcntl_setlk() races with close(), it removes the created lock with\ndo_lock_file_wait().\nHowever, LSMs can allow the first do_lock_file_wait() that created the lock\nwhile denying the second do_lock_file_wait() that tries to remove the lock.\nSeparately, posix_lock_file() could also fail to\nremove a lock due to GFP_KERNEL allocation failure (when splitting a range\nin the middle).\n\nAfter the bug has been triggered, use-after-free reads will occur in\nlock_get_status() when userspace reads /proc/locks. This can likely be used\nto read arbitrary kernel memory, but can't corrupt kernel memory.\n\nFix it by calling locks_remove_posix() instead, which is designed to\nreliably get rid of POSIX locks associated with the given file and\nfiles_struct and is also used by filp_flush()."
