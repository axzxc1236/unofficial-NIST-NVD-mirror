This is done in the workingset_test_recent()\nstep (which checks if the folio's eviction is recent).\n\nMove the stat flushing step to before the RCU read section of cachestat,\nand skip stat flushing during the recency check.\n\n[1]: https://lore.kernel.org/cgroups/000000000000f71227061bdf97e0@google.com/"
