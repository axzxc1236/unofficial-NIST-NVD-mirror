      "newValue": "Oceanic is a NodeJS library for interfacing with Discord. Prior to version 1.10.4, input to functions such as `Client.rest.channels.removeBan` is not url-encoded, resulting in specially crafted input such as `../../../channels/{id}` being normalized into the url `/api/v10/channels/{id}`, and deleting a channel rather than removing a ban. Version 1.10.4 fixes this issue. Some workarounds are available. One may sanitize user input, ensuring strings are valid for the purpose they are being used for. One may also encode input with `encodeURIComponent` before providing it to the library."
