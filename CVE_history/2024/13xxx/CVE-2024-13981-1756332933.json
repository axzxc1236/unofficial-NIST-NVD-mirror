      "newValue": "LiveBOS, an object-oriented business architecture middleware suite developed by Apex Software Co., Ltd., contains an arbitrary file upload vulnerability in its UploadFile.do;.js.jsp endpoint. This flaw affects the LiveBOS Server component and allows unauthenticated remote attackers to upload crafted files outside the intended directory structure via path traversal in the filename parameter. Successful exploitation may lead to remote code execution on the server, enabling full system compromise.Â The vulnerability is presumed to affect builds released prior to August 2024 and is said to be remediated in newer versions of the product, though the exact affected range remains undefined."
