      "newValue": "Multiple plugins and/or themes for WordPress using Smart Framework are vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting due to a missing capability check on the saveOptions() and importThemeOptions() functions in various versions. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to update the plugin's settings which includes custom JavaScript that is enabled site-wide. This issue was escalated to Envato over two months from the date of this disclosure and the issue is still vulnerable."
