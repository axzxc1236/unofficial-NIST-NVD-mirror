      "newValue": "The Database Backup and check Tables Automated With Scheduler 2024 plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due to insufficient file path validation in the 'database_backup_ajax_delete' function in all versions up to, and including, 2.35. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php). The vulnerability was partially patched in version 2.36."
