      "newValue": "The Product Input Fields for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to insufficient file type validation in the add_product_input_fields_to_order_item_meta() function in all versions up to, and including, 1.12.1. This may make it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible. Please note that by default the plugin is only vulnerable to a double extension file upload attack, unless an administrators leaves the accepted file extensions field blank which can make .php file uploads possible."
