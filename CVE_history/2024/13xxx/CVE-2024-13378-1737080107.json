      "newValue": "The Gravity Forms plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the ‘style_settings’ parameter in versions 2.9.0.1 up to, and including, 2.9.1.3 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. The attack is only successful in the Chrome web browser, and requires directly browsing the media file via the attachment post."
