      "oldValue": "The Civi - Job Board & Freelance Marketplace WordPress Theme plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass in all versions up to, and including, 2.1.4. This is due to a lack of randomization of a password created during Single Sign-On via Google or Facebook. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change the password of arbitrary Candidate-level users if the attacker knows the username assigned to the victim during account creation.",
      "newValue": "The Civi - Job Board & Freelance Marketplace WordPress Theme plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass in all versions up to, and including, 2.1.6.1. This is due to a lack of password randomization and user validation through the fb_ajax_login_or_register and google_ajax_login_or_register actions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to login as any user as long as they have access to the email."
