      "newValue": "A flaw was found in the FreeIPA API audit, where it sends the whole FreeIPA command line to journalctl. As a consequence, during the FreeIPA installation process, it inadvertently leaks the administrative user credentials, including the administrator password, to the journal database. In the worst-case scenario, where the journal log is centralized, users with access to it can have improper access to the FreeIPA administrator credentials."
