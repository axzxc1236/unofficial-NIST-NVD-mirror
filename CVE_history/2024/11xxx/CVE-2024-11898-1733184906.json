Boost subscribers, traffic, repeat visits,  referrals, sales and more plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's 'swin-campaign' shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 2.6.9 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes.
