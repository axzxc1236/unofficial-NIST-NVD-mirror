      "newValue": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nceph: give up on paths longer than PATH_MAX\n\nIf the full path to be built by ceph_mdsc_build_path() happens to be\nlonger than PATH_MAX, then this function will enter an endless (retry)\nloop, effectively blocking the whole task.  Most of the machine\nbecomes unusable, making this a very simple and effective DoS\nvulnerability.\n\nI cannot imagine why this retry was ever implemented, but it seems\nrather useless and harmful to me.  Let's remove it and fail with\nENAMETOOLONG instead."
