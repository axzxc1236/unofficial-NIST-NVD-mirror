      "type": "Description",
      "newValue": "python-multipart is a streaming multipart parser for Python. When parsing form data, python-multipart skips line breaks (CR \\r or LF \\n) in front of the first boundary and any tailing bytes after the last boundary. This happens one byte at a time and emits a log event each time, which may cause excessive logging for certain inputs. An attacker could abuse this by sending a malicious request with lots of data before the first or after the last boundary, causing high CPU load and stalling the processing thread for a significant amount of time. In case of ASGI application, this could stall the event loop and prevent other requests from being processed, resulting in a denial of service (DoS). This vulnerability is fixed in 0.0.18."
