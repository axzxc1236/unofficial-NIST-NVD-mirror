      "oldValue": "A serious vulnerability was discovered in FreePBX 17.0.19.17. FreePBX does not verify the type of uploaded files and does not restrict user access paths, allowing attackers to remotely control the FreePBX server by uploading malicious files with malicious content and accessing the default directory where the files are uploaded. This will result in particularly serious consequences.",
      "newValue": "A vulnerability was discovered in FreePBX 17.0.19.17. It does not verify the type of uploaded (valid FreePBX module) files, allowing high-privilege administrators to insert unwanted files. NOTE: the Supplier's position is that there is no risk beyond what high-privilege administrators are intentionally allowed to do."
