      "newValue": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndpll: fix pin dump crash for rebound module\n\nWhen a kernel module is unbound but the pin resources were not entirely\nfreed (other kernel module instance of the same PCI device have had kept\nthe reference to that pin), and kernel module is again bound, the pin\nproperties would not be updated (the properties are only assigned when\nmemory for the pin is allocated), prop pointer still points to the\nkernel module memory of the kernel module which was deallocated on the\nunbind.\n\nIf the pin dump is invoked in this state, the result is a kernel crash.\nPrevent the crash by storing persistent pin properties in dpll subsystem,\ncopy the content from the kernel module when pin is allocated, instead of\nusing memory of the kernel module."
