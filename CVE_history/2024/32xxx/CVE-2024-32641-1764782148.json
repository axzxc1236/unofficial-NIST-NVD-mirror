The vulnerability exists in the addParam function, which accepts user input via the criteria parameter. This input is subsequently evaluated by setDynamicContent, allowing an unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code via the m tag. The vulnerability is patched in versions 7.2.8, 7.3.13, and 7.4.6."
