      "newValue": "The The WP Photo Album Plus plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary shortcode execution via getshortcodedrenderedfenodelay AJAX action in all versions up to, and including, 8.8.08.007 . This is due to the software allowing users to execute an action that does not properly validate a value before running do_shortcode. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary shortcodes."
