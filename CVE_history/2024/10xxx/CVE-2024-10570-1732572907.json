      "newValue": "The Security & Malware scan by CleanTalk plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized SQL Injection due to an authorization bypass via reverse DNS spoofing on the checkWithoutToken function in all versions up to, and including, 2.145, as well as insufficient input sanitization and validation. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database."
