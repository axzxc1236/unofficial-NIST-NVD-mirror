      "type": "Description",
      "oldValue": "Velocidex WinPmem versions below 4.1 suffer from an Improper Input Validation vulnerability whereby an attacker can directly communicate with the driver by accessing the \\\"\\\\\\\\.\\\\pmem\\\" device. From that point, it is possible to communicate with the driver via regular device operations, starting with a system of IOCTLs. To send specific orders to the driver, one can use IRP_MJ_DEVICE_CONTROL control code. This issue is remediated in version 4.1.",
      "newValue": "Velocidex WinPmem versions 4.1 and below suffer from an Improper Input Validation vulnerability whereby an attacker with admin access can trigger a BSOD with a parallel thread changing the memory’s access right under the control of the user-mode application. This is due to verification only being performed at the beginning of the routine allowing the userspace to change page permissions half way through the routine.  A valid workaround is a rule to detect unauthorized loading of winpmem outside incident response operations."
