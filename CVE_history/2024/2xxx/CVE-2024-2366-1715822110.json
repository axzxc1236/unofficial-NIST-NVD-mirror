      "newValue": "A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the parisneo/lollms-webui application, specifically within the reinstall_binding functionality in lollms_core/lollms/server/endpoints/lollms_binding_infos.py of the latest version. The vulnerability arises due to insufficient path sanitization, allowing an attacker to exploit path traversal to navigate to arbitrary directories. By manipulating the binding_path to point to a controlled directory and uploading a malicious __init__.py file, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server."
