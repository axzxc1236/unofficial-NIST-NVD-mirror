      "newValue": "The Visual Footer Credit Remover plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the 'selector' parameter in all versions up to, and including, 2 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level access, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled."
