      "newValue": "parisneo/lollms-webui is vulnerable to path traversal attacks that can lead to remote code execution due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in the 'Database path' and 'PDF LaTeX path' settings. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by manipulating these settings to execute arbitrary code on the targeted server. The issue affects the latest version of the software. The vulnerability stems from the application's handling of the 'discussion_db_name' and 'pdf_latex_path' parameters, which do not properly validate file paths, allowing for directory traversal. This vulnerability can also lead to further file exposure and other attack vectors by manipulating the 'discussion_db_name' parameter."
