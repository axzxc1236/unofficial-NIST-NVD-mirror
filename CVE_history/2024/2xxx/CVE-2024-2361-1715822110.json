      "type": "Description",
      "newValue": "A vulnerability in the parisneo/lollms-webui allows for arbitrary file upload and read due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input. Specifically, the issue resides in the `install_model()` function within `lollms_core/lollms/binding.py`, where the application fails to properly sanitize the `file://` protocol and other inputs, leading to arbitrary read and upload capabilities. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by manipulating the `path` and `variant_name` parameters to achieve path traversal, allowing for the reading of arbitrary files and uploading files to arbitrary locations on the server. This vulnerability affects the latest version of parisneo/lollms-webui."
