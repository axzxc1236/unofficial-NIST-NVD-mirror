      "newValue": "The Contact Form Plugin by Fluent Forms for Quiz, Survey, and Drag & Drop WP Form Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via form settings in all versions up to, and including, 5.1.13 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with access to the Fluent Forms settings, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This can be chained with CVE-2024-2771 for a low-privileged user to inject malicious web scripts."
