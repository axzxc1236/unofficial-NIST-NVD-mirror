      "newValue": "This issue tracks two CWE-416 Use After Free (UAF) and one CWE-415 Double Free vulnerabilities in Goahead versions <= 6.0.0. These are caused by JST values not being nulled when freed during parsing of JST templates. If the ME_GOAHEAD_JAVASCRIPT flag is enabled, a remote attacker with the privileges to modify JavaScript template (JST) files could exploit this by providing malicious templates. This may lead to memory corruption, potentially causing a Denial of Service (DoS) or, in rare cases, code execution, though the latter is highly context-dependent."
