A malicious cobalt instance could serve links with the `javascript:` protocol, resulting in Cross-site Scripting (XSS) when the user tries to download an item from a picker. This issue has been present since commit `66bac03e`, was mitigated in commit `97977efa` (correctly configured web instances were no longer vulnerable) and fully fixed in commit `c4be1d3a` (included in release version 10.2.1). Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should enable a content-security-policy."
