      "newValue": "A vulnerability in open-webui/open-webui versions <= 0.3.8 allows remote code execution by non-admin users via Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). The application uses cookies with the SameSite attribute set to lax for authentication and lacks CSRF tokens. This allows an attacker to craft a malicious HTML that, when accessed by a victim, can modify the Python code of an existing pipeline and execute arbitrary code with the victim's privileges."
