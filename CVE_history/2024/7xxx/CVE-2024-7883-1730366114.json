      "type": "Description",
      "newValue": "When using Arm Cortex-M Security Extensions (CMSE), Secure stack \ncontents can be leaked to Non-secure state via floating-point registers \nwhen a Secure to Non-secure function call is made that returns a \nfloating-point value and when this is the first use of floating-point \nsince entering Secure state. This allows an attacker to read a limited \nquantity of Secure stack contents with an impact on confidentiality. \nThis issue is specific to code generated using LLVM-based compilers."
