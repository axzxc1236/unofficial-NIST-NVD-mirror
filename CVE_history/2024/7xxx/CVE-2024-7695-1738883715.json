This vulnerability is caused by insufficient input validation, which allows data to be written to memory outside the bounds of the buffer. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could result in a denial-of-service attack. \n\nThis vulnerability poses a significant remote threat if the affected products are exposed to publicly accessible networks. Attackers could potentially disrupt operations by shutting down the affected systems. Due to the critical nature of this security risk, we strongly recommend taking immediate action to prevent its potential exploitation.",
