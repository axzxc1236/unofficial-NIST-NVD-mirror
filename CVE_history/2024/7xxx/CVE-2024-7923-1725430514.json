      "newValue": "An authentication bypass vulnerability has been identified in Foreman when deployed with Gunicorn versions prior to 22.0, due to the puppet-foreman configuration. This issue arises from Apache's mod_proxy not properly unsetting headers because of restrictions on underscores in HTTP headers, allowing authentication through a malformed header. This flaw impacts all active Satellite deployments (6.13, 6.14 and 6.15) which are using Pulpcore version 4.0+ and could potentially enable unauthorized users to gain administrative access."
