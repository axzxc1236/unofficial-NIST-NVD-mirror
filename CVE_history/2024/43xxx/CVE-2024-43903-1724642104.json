      "newValue": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/amd/display: Add NULL check for 'afb' before dereferencing in amdgpu_dm_plane_handle_cursor_update\n\nThis commit adds a null check for the 'afb' variable in the\namdgpu_dm_plane_handle_cursor_update function. Previously, 'afb' was\nassumed to be null, but was used later in the code without a null check.\nThis could potentially lead to a null pointer dereference.\n\nFixes the below:\ndrivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../display/amdgpu_dm/amdgpu_dm_plane.c:1298 amdgpu_dm_plane_handle_cursor_update() error: we previously assumed 'afb' could be null (see line 1252)"
