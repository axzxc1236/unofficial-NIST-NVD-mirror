      "newValue": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ntracing: Fix overflow in get_free_elt()\n\n\"tracing_map->next_elt\" in get_free_elt() is at risk of overflowing.\n\nOnce it overflows, new elements can still be inserted into the tracing_map\neven though the maximum number of elements (`max_elts`) has been reached.\nContinuing to insert elements after the overflow could result in the\ntracing_map containing \"tracing_map->max_size\" elements, leaving no empty\nentries.\nIf any attempt is made to insert an element into a full tracing_map using\n`__tracing_map_insert()`, it will cause an infinite loop with preemption\ndisabled, leading to a CPU hang problem.\n\nFix this by preventing any further increments to \"tracing_map->next_elt\"\nonce it reaches \"tracing_map->max_elt\"."
