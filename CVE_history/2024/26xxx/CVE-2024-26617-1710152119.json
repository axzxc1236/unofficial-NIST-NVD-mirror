The notifier will invalidate\nmemory range.  Depending upon the number of iterations, different memory\nranges would be invalidated.\n\nThe following warning would be removed by this patch:\nWARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 5067 at arch/x86/kvm/../../../virt/kvm/kvm_main.c:734 kvm_mmu_notifier_change_pte+0x860/0x960 arch/x86/kvm/../../../virt/kvm/kvm_main.c:734\n\nThere is no behavioural and performance change with this patch when\nthere is no component registered with the mmu notifier.\n\n[akpm@linux-foundation.org: narrow the scope of `range', per Sean]"
