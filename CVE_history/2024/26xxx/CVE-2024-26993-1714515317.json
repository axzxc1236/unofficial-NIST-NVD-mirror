      "newValue": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nfs: sysfs: Fix reference leak in sysfs_break_active_protection()\n\nThe sysfs_break_active_protection() routine has an obvious reference\nleak in its error path.  If the call to kernfs_find_and_get() fails then\nkn will be NULL, so the companion sysfs_unbreak_active_protection()\nroutine won't get called (and would only cause an access violation by\ntrying to dereference kn->parent if it was called).  As a result, the\nreference to kobj acquired at the start of the function will never be\nreleased.\n\nFix the leak by adding an explicit kobject_put() call when kn is NULL."
