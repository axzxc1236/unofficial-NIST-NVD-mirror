If NR_CPUS threads call\ndo_task_stat() at the same time and the process has NR_THREADS, it will\nspin with irqs disabled O(NR_CPUS * NR_THREADS) time.\n\nChange do_task_stat() to use sig->stats_lock to gather the statistics\noutside of ->siglock protected section, in the likely case this code will\nrun lockless."
