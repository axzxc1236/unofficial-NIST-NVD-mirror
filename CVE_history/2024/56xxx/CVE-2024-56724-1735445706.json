      "newValue": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmfd: intel_soc_pmic_bxtwc: Use IRQ domain for TMU device\n\nWhile design wise the idea of converting the driver to use\nthe hierarchy of the IRQ chips is correct, the implementation\nhas (inherited) flaws. This was unveiled when platform_get_irq()\nhad started WARN() on IRQ 0 that is supposed to be a Linux\nIRQ number (also known as vIRQ).\n\nRework the driver to respect IRQ domain when creating each MFD\ndevice separately, as the domain is not the same for all of them."
