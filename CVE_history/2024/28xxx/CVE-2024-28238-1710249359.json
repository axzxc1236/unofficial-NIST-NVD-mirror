      "newValue": "Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. When reaching the /files page, a JWT is passed via GET request. Inclusion of session tokens in URLs poses a security risk as URLs are often logged in various places (e.g., web server logs, browser history). Attackers gaining access to these logs may hijack active user sessions, leading to unauthorized access to sensitive information or actions on behalf of the user. This issue has been addressed in version 10.10.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."
