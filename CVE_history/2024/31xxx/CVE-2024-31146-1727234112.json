      "newValue": "When multiple devices share resources and one of them is to be passed\nthrough to a guest, security of the entire system and of respective\nguests individually cannot really be guaranteed without knowing\ninternals of any of the involved guests.  Therefore such a configuration\ncannot really be security-supported, yet making that explicit was so far\nmissing.\n\nResources the sharing of which is known to be problematic include, but\nare not limited to\n- - PCI Base Address Registers (BARs) of multiple devices mapping to the\n  same page (4k on x86),\n- - INTx lines."
