      "newValue": "Minder by Stacklok is an open source software supply chain security platform. A refactoring in commit `5c381cf` added the ability to get GitHub repositories registered to a project without specifying a specific provider.  Unfortunately, the SQL query for doing so was missing parenthesis, and would select a random repository. This issue is patched in pull request 2941. As a workaround, revert prior to `5c381cf`, or roll forward past `2eb94e7`."
