      "newValue": "XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform. Starting in version 3.1 and prior to versions 4.10.20, 15.5.4, and 15.10-rc-1, it is possible to schedule/trigger/unschedule existing jobs by having an admin visit the Job Scheduler page through a predictable URL, for example by embedding such an URL in any content as an image. The vulnerability has been fixed in XWiki 14.10.19, 15.5.5, and 15.9. As a workaround, manually apply the patch by modifying the `Scheduler.WebHome` page."
