      "newValue": "Fides is an open-source privacy engineering platform, and `SERVER_SIDE_FIDES_API_URL` is a server-side configuration environment variable used by the Fides Privacy Center to communicate with the Fides webserver backend. The value of this variable is a URL which typically includes a private IP address, private domain name, and/or port. A vulnerability present starting in version 2.19.0 and prior to version 2.39.2rc0 allows an unauthenticated attacker to make a HTTP GET request from the Privacy Center that discloses the value of this server-side URL. This could result in disclosure of server-side configuration giving an attacker information on server-side ports, private IP addresses, and/or private domain names. The vulnerability has been patched in Fides version 2.39.2rc0. No known workarounds are available."
