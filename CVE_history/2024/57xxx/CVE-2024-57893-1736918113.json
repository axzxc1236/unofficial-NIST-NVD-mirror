      "newValue": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nALSA: seq: oss: Fix races at processing SysEx messages\n\nOSS sequencer handles the SysEx messages split in 6 bytes packets, and\nALSA sequencer OSS layer tries to combine those.  It stores the data\nin the internal buffer and this access is racy as of now, which may\nlead to the out-of-bounds access.\n\nAs a temporary band-aid fix, introduce a mutex for serializing the\nprocess of the SysEx message packets."
