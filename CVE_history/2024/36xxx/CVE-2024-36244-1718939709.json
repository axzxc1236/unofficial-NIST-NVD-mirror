      "newValue": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet/sched: taprio: extend minimum interval restriction to entire cycle too\n\nIt is possible for syzbot to side-step the restriction imposed by the\nblamed commit in the Fixes: tag, because the taprio UAPI permits a\ncycle-time different from (and potentially shorter than) the sum of\nentry intervals.\n\nWe need one more restriction, which is that the cycle time itself must\nbe larger than N * ETH_ZLEN bit times, where N is the number of schedule\nentries. This restriction needs to apply regardless of whether the cycle\ntime came from the user or was the implicit, auto-calculated value, so\nwe move the existing \"cycle == 0\" check outside the \"if \"(!new->cycle_time)\"\nbranch. This way covers both conditions and scenarios.\n\nAdd a selftest which illustrates the issue triggered by syzbot."
