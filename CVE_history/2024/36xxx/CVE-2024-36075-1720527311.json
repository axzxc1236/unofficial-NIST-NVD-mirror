      "type": "Description",
      "oldValue": "Netwrix CoSoSys Endpoint Protector through 5.9.3 and CoSoSys Unify through 7.0.6 contain a remote code execution vulnerability in the application configuration component of the Endpoint Protector and Unify agent which allows a remote, unauthenticated attacker to manipulate the configuration of either their own or another client endpoint resulting in the bypass of certain configuration options. Manipulation of the application configuration can result in local policy bypass and in some scenarios remote code execution.",
      "newValue": "The CoSoSys Endpoint Protector through 5.9.3 and Unify agent through 7.0.6 is susceptible to an arbitrary code execution vulnerability due to the way an archive obtained from the Endpoint Protector or Unify server is extracted on the endpoint. An attacker who is able to modify the archive on the server could obtain remote code execution as an administrator on an endpoint."
