      "newValue": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbpf: Check bloom filter map value size\n\nThis patch adds a missing check to bloom filter creating, rejecting\nvalues above KMALLOC_MAX_SIZE. This brings the bloom map in line with\nmany other map types.\n\nThe lack of this protection can cause kernel crashes for value sizes\nthat overflow int's. Such a crash was caught by syzkaller. The next\npatch adds more guard-rails at a lower level."
