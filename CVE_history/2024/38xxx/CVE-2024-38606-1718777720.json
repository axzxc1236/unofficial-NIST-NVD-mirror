      "newValue": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncrypto: qat - validate slices count returned by FW\n\nThe function adf_send_admin_tl_start() enables the telemetry (TL)\nfeature on a QAT device by sending the ICP_QAT_FW_TL_START message to\nthe firmware. This triggers the FW to start writing TL data to a DMA\nbuffer in memory and returns an array containing the number of\naccelerators of each type (slices) supported by this HW.\nThe pointer to this array is stored in the adf_tl_hw_data data\nstructure called slice_cnt.\n\nThe array slice_cnt is then used in the function tl_print_dev_data()\nto report in debugfs only statistics about the supported accelerators.\nAn incorrect value of the elements in slice_cnt might lead to an out\nof bounds memory read.\nAt the moment, there isn't an implementation of FW that returns a wrong\nvalue, but for robustness validate the slice count array returned by FW."
