An attacker can decrypt ciphertexts by exploiting this vulnerability. Exploiting this vulnerability requires the attacker to have access to a large number of ciphertexts encrypted with the same key.\r\r Workaround \r\rThis vulnerability can be mitigated by finding and replacing RSA and RSAOAEP decryption with another crypto library.",
