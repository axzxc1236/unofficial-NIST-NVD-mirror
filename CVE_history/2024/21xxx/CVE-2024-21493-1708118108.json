      "newValue": "All versions of the package github.com/greenpau/caddy-security are vulnerable to Improper Validation of Array Index when parsing a Caddyfile. Multiple parsing functions in the affected library do not validate whether their input values are nil before attempting to access elements, which can lead to a panic (index out of range). Panics during the parsing of a configuration file may introduce ambiguity and vulnerabilities, hindering the correct interpretation and configuration of the web server."
