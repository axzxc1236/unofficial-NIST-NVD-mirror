Continued receipt and processing of this traffic will create a sustained DoS condition.\n\nThis issue affects Junos OS on SRX Series:\n\n  *  21.4 versions before 21.4R3-S7.9,\n  *  22.1 versions before 22.1R3-S5.3,\n  *  22.2 versions before 22.2R3-S4.11,\n  *  22.3 versions before 22.3R3,\n  *  22.4 versions before 22.4R3.\n\n\n\n\nJunos OS versions prior to 21.4R1 are not affected by this issue.",
