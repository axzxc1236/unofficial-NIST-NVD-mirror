      "newValue": "All versions of the package dom-iterator are vulnerable to Arbitrary Code Execution due to use of the Function constructor without complete input sanitization. Function generates a new function body and thus care must be given to ensure that the inputs to Function are not attacker-controlled. The risks involved are similar to that of allowing attacker-controlled input to reach eval."
