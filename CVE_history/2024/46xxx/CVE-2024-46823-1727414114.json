However, it is being used as\na driver name when calling 'kunit_driver_create' from\n'kunit_device_register'. It produces the kernel panic with KASAN\nenabled.\n\nSince this variable is used in one place only, remove it and pass the\ndevice name into kunit_device_register directly as an ascii string."
