      "newValue": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nethtool: fail closed if we can't get max channel used in indirection tables\n\nCommit 0d1b7d6c9274 (\"bnxt: fix crashes when reducing ring count with\nactive RSS contexts\") proves that allowing indirection table to contain\nchannels with out of bounds IDs may lead to crashes. Currently the\nmax channel check in the core gets skipped if driver can't fetch\nthe indirection table or when we can't allocate memory.\n\nBoth of those conditions should be extremely rare but if they do\nhappen we should try to be safe and fail the channel change."
