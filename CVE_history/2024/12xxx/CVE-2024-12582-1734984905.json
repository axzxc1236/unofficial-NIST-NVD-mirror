      "newValue": "A flaw was found in the skupper console,  a read-only interface that renders cluster network, traffic details, and metrics for a network application that a user sets up across a hybrid multi-cloud environment. When the default authentication method is used, a random password is generated for the \"admin\" user and is persisted in either a Kubernetes secret or a podman volume in a plaintext file. This authentication method can be manipulated by an attacker, leading to the reading of any user-readable file in the container filesystem, directly impacting data confidentiality. Additionally, the attacker may induce skupper to read extremely large files into memory, resulting in resource exhaustion and a denial of service attack."
