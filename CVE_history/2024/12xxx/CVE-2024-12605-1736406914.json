This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the \"al_scribe_engine_request_data\" and \"al_scribe_content_data\" actions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update plugin settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
