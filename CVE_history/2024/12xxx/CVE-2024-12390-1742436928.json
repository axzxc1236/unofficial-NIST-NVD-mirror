      "newValue": "A vulnerability in binary-husky/gpt_academic version git 310122f allows for remote code execution. The application supports the extraction of user-provided RAR files without proper validation. The Python rarfile module, which supports symlinks, can be exploited to perform arbitrary file writes. This can lead to remote code execution by writing to sensitive files such as SSH keys, crontab files, or the application's own code."
