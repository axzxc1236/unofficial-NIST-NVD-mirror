      "newValue": "The DWT - Directory & Listing WordPress Theme theme for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation via account takeover in all versions up to, and including, 3.3.6. This is due to the plugin not properly checking for an empty token value prior to resetting a user's password through the dwt_listing_reset_password() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change arbitrary user's passwords, including administrators, and leverage that to gain access to their account."
