      "type": "Description",
      "oldValue": "Velocidex WinPmem versions below 4.1 suffer from an Out of Bounds Write vulnerability whereby an attacker can subvert code-signing facilities leading to the ability to write the value zero anywhere in memory with the driver – without using the\\nPMEM_WRITE_ENABLED compilation flag. This issue is remediated in version 4.1.",
      "newValue": "Velocidex WinPmem versions below 4.1 suffer from an Out of Bounds Write vulnerability. By using an IO Control, a user space program can trick the driver into writing a 0 into any chosen memory location. In conjunction with information leakage from the WinPmem driver, attackers can discover the location in memory for the  g_CiOptions global symbol. This can be leveraged to disable signed driver enforcement on the target system - allowing attackers to load unsigned drivers."
