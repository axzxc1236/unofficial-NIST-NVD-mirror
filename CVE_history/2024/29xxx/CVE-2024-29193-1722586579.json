      "oldValue": "gotortc is a camera streaming application. Versions 1.8.5 and prior are vulnerable to DOM-based cross-site scripting. The index page (`index.html`) shows the available streams by fetching the API (`[0]`) in the client side. Then, it uses `Object.entries` to iterate over the result (`[1]`) whose first item (`name`) gets appended using `innerHTML` (`[2]`). In the event of a victim visiting the server in question, their browser will execute the request against the go2rtc instance. After the request, the browser will be redirected to go2rtc, in which the XSS would be executed in the context of go2rtc’s origin. As of time of publication, no patch is available.",
