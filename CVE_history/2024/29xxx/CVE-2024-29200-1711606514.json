      "newValue": "Kimai is a web-based multi-user time-tracking application. The permission `view_other_timesheet` performs differently for the Kimai UI and the API, thus returning unexpected data through the API. When setting the `view_other_timesheet` permission to true, on the frontend, users can only see timesheet entries for teams they are a part of. When requesting all timesheets from the API, however, all timesheet entries are returned, regardless of whether the user shares team permissions or not. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.13.0."
