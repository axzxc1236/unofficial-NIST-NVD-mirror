Implementing proper certificate validation by passing context=ssl.create_default_context() during FTP_TLS instantiation is used as mitigation to validate the certificates properly.\n\nThis issue affects Apache Airflow FTP Provider: before 3.7.0.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 3.7.0, which fixes the issue.\n\n",
