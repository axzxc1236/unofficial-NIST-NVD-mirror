      "newValue": "Hoppscotch is an API development ecosystem.  Due to lack of validation for fields like Label (Edit Team) - TeamName, bad actors can send emails with Spoofed Content as Hoppscotch. Part of payload (external link) is presented in clickable form - easier to achieve own goals by malicious actors.  This issue is fixed in 2023.12.6."
