      "newValue": "OpenZeppelin Contracts is a library for secure smart contract development. The `Base64.encode` function encodes a `bytes` input by iterating over it in chunks of 3 bytes. When this input is not a multiple of 3, the last iteration may read parts of the memory that are beyond the input buffer. The vulnerability is fixed in 5.0.2 and 4.9.6."
