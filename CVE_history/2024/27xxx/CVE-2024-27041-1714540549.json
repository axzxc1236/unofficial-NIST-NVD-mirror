      "newValue": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/amd/display: fix NULL checks for adev->dm.dc in amdgpu_dm_fini()\n\nSince 'adev->dm.dc' in amdgpu_dm_fini() might turn out to be NULL\nbefore the call to dc_enable_dmub_notifications(), check\nbeforehand to ensure there will not be a possible NULL-ptr-deref\nthere.\n\nAlso, since commit 1e88eb1b2c25 (\"drm/amd/display: Drop\nCONFIG_DRM_AMD_DC_HDCP\") there are two separate checks for NULL in\n'adev->dm.dc' before dc_deinit_callbacks() and dc_dmub_srv_destroy().\nClean up by combining them all under one 'if'.\n\nFound by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with static\nanalysis tool SVACE."
