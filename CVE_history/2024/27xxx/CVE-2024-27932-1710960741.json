      "type": "Description",
      "newValue": "Deno is a JavaScript, TypeScript, and WebAssembly runtime. Starting in version 1.8.0 and prior to version 1.40.4, Deno improperly checks that an import specifier's hostname is equal to or a child of a token's hostname, which can cause tokens to be sent to servers they shouldn't be sent to. An auth token intended for `example[.]com` may be sent to `notexample[.]com`. Anyone who uses DENO_AUTH_TOKENS and imports potentially untrusted code is affected. Version 1.40.0 contains a patch for this issue"
