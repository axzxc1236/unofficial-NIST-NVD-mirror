      "newValue": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nthermal/debugfs: Add missing count increment to thermal_debug_tz_trip_up()\n\nThe count field in struct trip_stats, representing the number of times\nthe zone temperature was above the trip point, needs to be incremented\nin thermal_debug_tz_trip_up(), for two reasons.\n\nFirst, if a trip point is crossed on the way up for the first time,\nthermal_debug_update_temp() called from update_temperature() does\nnot see it because it has not been added to trips_crossed[] array\nin the thermal zone's struct tz_debugfs object yet.  Therefore, when\nthermal_debug_tz_trip_up() is called after that, the trip point's\ncount value is 0, and the attempt to divide by it during the average\ntemperature computation leads to a divide error which causes the kernel\nto crash.  Setting the count to 1 before the division by incrementing it\nfixes this problem.\n\nSecond, if a trip point is crossed on the way up, but it has been\ncrossed on the way up already before, its count value needs to be\nincremented to make a record of the fact that the zone temperature is\nabove the trip now.  Without doing that, if the mitigations applied\nafter crossing the trip cause the zone temperature to drop below its\nthreshold, the count will not be updated for this episode at all and\nthe average temperature in the trip statistics record will be somewhat\nhigher than it should be.\n\nCc :6.8+ <stable@vger.kernel.org> # 6.8+"
