An issue exists within GEONODE where the current rich text editor is vulnerable to Stored XSS. The applications cookies are set securely, but it is possible to retrieve a victims CSRF token and issue a request to change another user's email address to perform a full account takeover. Due to the script element not impacting the CORS policy, requests will succeed. This vulnerability is fixed in 4.2.3."
