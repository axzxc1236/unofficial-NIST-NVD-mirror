      "newValue": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmedia: edia: dvbdev: fix a use-after-free\n\nIn dvb_register_device, *pdvbdev is set equal to dvbdev, which is freed\nin several error-handling paths. However, *pdvbdev is not set to NULL\nafter dvbdev's deallocation, causing use-after-frees in many places,\nfor example, in the following call chain:\n\nbudget_register\n  |-> dvb_dmxdev_init\n        |-> dvb_register_device\n  |-> dvb_dmxdev_release\n        |-> dvb_unregister_device\n              |-> dvb_remove_device\n                    |-> dvb_device_put\n                          |-> kref_put\n\nWhen calling dvb_unregister_device, dmxdev->dvbdev (i.e. *pdvbdev in\ndvb_register_device) could point to memory that had been freed in\ndvb_register_device. Thereafter, this pointer is transferred to\nkref_put and triggering a use-after-free."
