      "newValue": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmedia: v4l: async: Fix notifier list entry init\n\nstruct v4l2_async_notifier has several list_head members, but only\nwaiting_list and done_list are initialized. notifier_entry was kept\n'zeroed' leading to an uninitialized list_head.\nThis results in a NULL-pointer dereference if csi2_async_register() fails,\ne.g. node for remote endpoint is disabled, and returns -ENOTCONN.\nThe following calls to v4l2_async_nf_unregister() results in a NULL\npointer dereference.\nAdd the missing list head initializer."
