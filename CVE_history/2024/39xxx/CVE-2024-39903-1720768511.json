      "newValue": "Solara is a pure Python, React-style framework for scaling Jupyter and web apps. A Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability was identified in widgetti/solara, in version <1.35.1, which was fixed in version 1.35.1. This vulnerability arises from the application's failure to properly validate URI fragments for directory traversal sequences such as '../' when serving static files. An attacker can exploit this flaw by manipulating the fragment part of the URI to read arbitrary files on the local file system."
