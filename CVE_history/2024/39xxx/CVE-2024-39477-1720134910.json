This is because\nvma_needs_reservation() can return -ENOMEM if\nallocate_file_region_entries() fails to allocate the file_region struct\nfor the reservation.\n\nCheck for that and do not call vma_add_reservation() if that is the case,\notherwise region_abort() and region_del() will see that we do not have any\nfile_regions.\n\nIf we detect that vma_needs_reservation() returned -ENOMEM, we clear the\nhugetlb_restore_reserve flag as if this reservation was still consumed, so\nfree_huge_folio() will not increment the resv count.\n\n[1] https://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/0000000000004096100617c58d54@google.com/T/#ma5983bc1ab18a54910da83416b3f89f3c7ee43aa"
