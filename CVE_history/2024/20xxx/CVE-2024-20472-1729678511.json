An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the application as an Administrator and sending crafted SQL queries to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to obtain unauthorized data from the database and make changes to the system. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need Administrator-level privileges."
