      "newValue": "The goTenna Pro ATAK Plugin does not use SecureRandom when generating \npasswords for sharing cryptographic keys. The random function in use \nmakes it easier for attackers to brute force this password if the \nbroadcasted encryption key is captured over RF. This only applies to the\n optional broadcast of an encryption key, so it is advised to share the \nkey with local QR code for higher security operations."
