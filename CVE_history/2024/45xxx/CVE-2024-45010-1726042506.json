This will decrement the local_addr_used\ncounter, which is wrong in this case because this counter is linked to\n'subflow' endpoints, and here it is a 'signal' endpoint that is being\nremoved.\n\nNow, the counter is decremented, only if the ID is being used outside\nof mptcp_pm_nl_rm_addr_or_subflow(), only for 'subflow' endpoints, and\nif the ID is not 0 -- local_addr_used is not taking into account these\nones. This marking of the ID as being available, and the decrement is\ndone no matter if a subflow using this ID is currently available,\nbecause the subflow could have been closed before."
