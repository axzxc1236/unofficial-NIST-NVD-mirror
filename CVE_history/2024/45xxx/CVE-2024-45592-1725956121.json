      "newValue": "auditor-bundle, formerly known as DoctrineAuditBundle, integrates auditor library into any Symfony 3.4+ application. Prior to 6.0.0, there is an unescaped entity property enabling Javascript injection. This is possible because %source_label% in twig macro is not escaped. Therefore script tags can be inserted and are executed. The vulnerability is fixed in 6.0.0."
