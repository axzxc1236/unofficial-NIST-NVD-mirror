      "oldValue": "i-Educar is free, completely online school management software that allows school secretaries, teachers, coordinators and area managers. In affected versions Creating a SQL query from a concatenation of a user-controlled GET parameter allows an attacker to manipulate the query. Successful exploitation of this flaw allows an attacker to have complete and unrestricted access to the database, with a web user with minimal permissions. This may involve obtaining user information, such as emails, password hashes, etc. This issue has not yet been patched. Users are advised to contact the developer and to coordinate an update schedule.",
      "newValue": "i-Educar is free, fully online school management software that can be used by school secretaries, teachers, coordinators, and area managers. A SQL Injection vulnerability was found prior to the 2.9 branch in the `ieducar/intranet/funcionario_vinculo_det.php` file, which creates the query by concatenating the unsanitized GET parameter `cod_func`, allowing the attacker to obtain sensitive information such as emails and password hashes. Commit 7824b95745fa2da6476b9901041d9c854bf52ffe fixes the issue."
