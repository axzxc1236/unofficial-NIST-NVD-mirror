      "newValue": "FastDDS is a C++ implementation of the DDS (Data Distribution Service) standard of the OMG (Object Management Group). Prior to versions 2.14.1, 2.13.5, 2.10.4, and 2.6.8, when a publisher serves malformed `RTPS` packet, heap buffer overflow occurs on the subscriber. This can remotely crash any Fast-DDS process, potentially leading to a DOS attack. Versions 2.14.1, 2.13.5, 2.10.4, and 2.6.8 contain a patch for the issue.\n"
