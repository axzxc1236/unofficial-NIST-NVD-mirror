      "oldValue": "An unauthorized access vulnerability has been discovered in ROS Melodic Morenia versions where ROS_VERSION is 1 and ROS_PYTHON_VERSION is 3. This vulnerability could potentially allow a malicious user to gain unauthorized information access to multiple ROS nodes remotely. Unauthorized information access to these nodes could result in compromised system integrity, the execution of arbitrary commands, and disclosure of sensitive information.",
