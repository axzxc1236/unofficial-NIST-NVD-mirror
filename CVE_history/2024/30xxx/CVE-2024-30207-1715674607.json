The affected systems use symmetric cryptography with a hard-coded key to protect the communication between client and server. This could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to compromise confidentiality and integrity of the communication and, subsequently, availability of the system.\r\nA successful exploit requires the attacker to gain knowledge of the hard-coded key and to be able to intercept the communication between client and server on the network."
