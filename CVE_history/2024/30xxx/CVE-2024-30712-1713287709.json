      "oldValue": "A shell injection vulnerability was discovered in ROS2 (Robot Operating System 2) Dashing Diademata in ROS_VERSION 2 and ROS_PYTHON_VERSION 3, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code, escalate privileges, and obtain sensitive information due to the way ROS2 handles shell command execution in components like command interpreters or interfaces that process external inputs.",

NOTE: this is disputed by multiple third parties who believe there was not reasonable evidence to determine the existence of a vulnerability."
