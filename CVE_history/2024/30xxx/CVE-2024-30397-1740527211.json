Upon a failed verification, the pkid uses all CPU resources and becomes unresponsive to future verification attempts. This means that all subsequent VPN negotiations depending on certificate verification will fail.\n\nThis CPU utilization of pkid can be checked using this command: \n  root@srx> show system processes extensive | match pkid\n  xxxxx ?root ?103? 0 ?846M ?136M ?CPU1 ?1 569:00 100.00% pkid\n\nThis issue affects:\nJuniper Networks Junos OS\n  *  All versions prior to 20.4R3-S10;\n  *  21.2 versions prior to 21.2R3-S7;\n  *  21.4 versions prior to 21.4R3-S5;\n  *  22.1 versions prior to 22.1R3-S4;\n  *  22.2 versions prior to 22.2R3-S3;\n  *  22.3 versions prior to 22.3R3-S1;\n  *  22.4 versions prior to 22.4R3;\n  *  23.2 versions prior to 23.2R1-S2, 23.2R2.",
