      "newValue": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nwifi: mt76: mt7921s: fix potential hung tasks during chip recovery\n\nDuring chip recovery (e.g. chip reset), there is a possible situation that\nkernel worker reset_work is holding the lock and waiting for kernel thread\nstat_worker to be parked, while stat_worker is waiting for the release of\nthe same lock.\nIt causes a deadlock resulting in the dumping of hung tasks messages and\npossible rebooting of the device.\n\nThis patch prevents the execution of stat_worker during the chip recovery."
