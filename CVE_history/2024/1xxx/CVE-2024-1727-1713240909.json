      "type": "Description",
      "oldValue": "To prevent malicious 3rd party websites from making requests to Gradio applications running locally, this PR tightens the CORS rules around Gradio applications. In particular, it checks to see if the host header is localhost (or one of its aliases) and if so, it requires the origin header (if present) to be localhost (or one of its aliases) as well.\n\n",
      "newValue": "A Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in gradio-app/gradio allows attackers to upload multiple large files to a victim's system if they are running Gradio locally. By crafting a malicious HTML page that triggers an unauthorized file upload to the victim's server, an attacker can deplete the system's disk space, potentially leading to a denial of service. This issue affects the file upload functionality as implemented in gradio/routes.py."
