The memory leak happens in github.com/golang-fips/openssl/openssl/rsa.go#L113. The objects leaked are pkey? and ctx?. That function uses named return parameters to free pkey? and ctx? if there is an error initializing the context or setting the different properties. All return statements related to error cases follow the \"return nil, nil, fail(...)\" pattern, meaning that pkey? and ctx? will be nil inside the deferred function that should free them.",
