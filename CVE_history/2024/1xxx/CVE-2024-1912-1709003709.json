This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the categorifyAjaxUpdateFolderPosition function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update the folder position of categories as well as update the metadata of other taxonomies via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link."
