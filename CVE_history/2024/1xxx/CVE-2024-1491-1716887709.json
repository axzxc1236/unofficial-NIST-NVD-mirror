This file system serves as the basis for the HTTP2 web \nserver module, but is also used by the SNMP module and is available to \nother applications that require basic read-only storage capabilities. \nThis can be exploited to overwrite the flash program memory that holds \nthe web server's main interfaces and execute arbitrary code.\n\n",
