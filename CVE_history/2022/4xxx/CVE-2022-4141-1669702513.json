      "oldValue": "The target's backtrace indicates that libc has detected a heap error or that the target was executing a heap function when it stopped. This could be due to heap corruption, passing a bad pointer to a heap function such as free(), etc. Since heap errors might include buffer overflows, use-after-free situations, etc. they are generally considered exploitable.",
      "newValue": "Heap based buffer overflow in vim/vim 9.0.0946 and below by allowing an attacker to CTRL-W gf in the expression used in the RHS of the substitute command."
