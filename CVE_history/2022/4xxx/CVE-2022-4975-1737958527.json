      "newValue": "A flaw was found in the Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security (RHACS) portal. When rendering a table view in the portal, for example, on any of the /main/configmanagement/* endpoints, the front-end generates a DOM table-element (id=\"pdf-table\"). This information is then populated with unsanitized data using innerHTML. An attacker with some control over the data rendered can trigger a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability."
