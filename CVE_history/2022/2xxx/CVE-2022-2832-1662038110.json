      "oldValue": "When rendering with headless builds, show an error instead of crashing. Previously GPU_backend_init was called indirectly from DRW_opengl_context_create, a new function is now called from the window manager (GPU_backend_init_once), so it's possible to check if the GPU has a back-end. This also disables the bgl Python module when building WITH_HEADLESS.",
      "newValue": "A flaw was found in Blender 3.3.0. A null pointer dereference exists in source/blender/gpu/opengl/gl_backend.cc that may lead to loss of confidentiality and integrity."
