      "oldValue": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Kepware KEPServerEX V6.11.718.0. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the handling of text encoding conversions. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a heap-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of SYSTEM. Was ZDI-CAN-16486.",
