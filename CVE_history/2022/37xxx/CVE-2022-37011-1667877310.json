Affected versions of the module insufficiently protect from packet capture replay. This could allow unauthorized remote attackers to bypass authentication and get access to the application. For compatibility reasons, fix versions still contain this issue, but only when the not recommended, non default configuration option `'Allow Idp Initiated Authentication'` is enabled.",
