      "oldValue": "A vulnerability was found in X.Org. The issue occurs due to the swap handler for the XTestFakeInput request of the XTest extension, possibly corrupting the stack if GenericEvents with lengths larger than 32 bytes are sent through the XTestFakeInput request. This flaw can lead to local privilege elevation on systems where the X server runs privileged and remote code execution for ssh X forwarding sessions. This issue does not affect systems where the client and server use the same byte order.",
