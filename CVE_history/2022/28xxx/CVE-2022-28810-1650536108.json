      "oldValue": "Zoho ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus before 6122 allows an authenticated user to achieve remote code execution via executable CMD.EXE input in a password field, This only occurs if a certain password sync feature is enabled that uses passwords as script arguments.",
      "newValue": "Zoho ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus before build 6122 allows a remote authenticated administrator to execute arbitrary operating OS commands as SYSTEM via the policy custom script feature. Due to the use of a default administrator password, attackers may be able to abuse this functionality with minimal effort. Additionally, a remote and partially authenticated attacker may be able to inject arbitrary commands into the custom script due to an unsanitized password field."
