      "oldValue": "The IBM Toolbox for Java (Db2 Mirror for i 7.4 and 7.5) could allow a user to obtain sensitive information, caused by utilizing a Java string for processing. Since Java strings are immutable, their contents exist in memory until garbage collected. This means sensitive data could be visible in memory over an indefinite amount of time. IBM has addressed this issue by reducing the amount of time the sensitive data is visible in memory. IBM X-Force ID: 241675.",
