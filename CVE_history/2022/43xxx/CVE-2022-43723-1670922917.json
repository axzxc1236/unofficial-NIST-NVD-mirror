Affected software does not properly validate the input for a certain parameter in the s7ontcp.dll. This could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to send messages and create a denial of service condition as the application crashes.\nAt the time of assigning the CVE, the affected firmware version of the component has already been superseded by succeeding mainline versions.",
