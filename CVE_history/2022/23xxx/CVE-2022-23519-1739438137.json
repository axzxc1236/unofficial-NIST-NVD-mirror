Prior to version 1.4.4, a possible XSS vulnerability with certain configurations of Rails::Html::Sanitizer may allow an attacker to inject content if the application developer has overridden the sanitizer's allowed tags in either of the following ways: allow both \"math\" and \"style\" elements,  or allow both \"svg\" and \"style\" elements. Code is only impacted if allowed tags are being overridden. . This issue is fixed in version 1.4.4. All users overriding the allowed tags to include \"math\" or \"svg\" and \"style\" should either upgrade or use the following workaround immediately: Remove \"style\" from the overridden allowed tags, or remove \"math\" and \"svg\" from the overridden allowed tags.\n",
