      "oldValue": "node SAML is a SAML 2.0 library based on the SAML implementation of passport-saml. A remote attacker may be able to bypass SAML authentication on a website using passport-saml. A successful attack requires that the attacker is in possession of an arbitrary IDP signed XML element. Depending on the IDP used, fully unauthenticated attacks (e.g without access to a valid user) might also be feasible if generation of a signed message can be triggered. Users should upgrade to node-saml version 4.0.0-beta5 or newer.  Disabling SAML authentication may be done as a workaround.",
