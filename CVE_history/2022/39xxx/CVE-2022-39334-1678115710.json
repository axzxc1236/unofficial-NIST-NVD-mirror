      "type": "Description",
      "oldValue": "Nextcloud desktop is the desktop sync client for Nextcloud. Versions prior to 3.6.1 would incorrectly trust invalid TLS certificates. A Man-in-the-middle attack is possible in case a user can be made running a nextcloudcmd CLI command locally. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Desktop client is upgraded to 3.6.1. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",
      "newValue": "Nextcloud also ships a CLI utility called nextcloudcmd which is sometimes used for automated scripting and headless servers. Versions of nextcloudcmd prior to 3.6.1 would incorrectly trust invalid TLS certificates, which may enable a Man-in-the-middle attack that exposes sensitive data or credentials to a network attacker. This affects the CLI only. It does not affect the standard GUI desktop Nextcloud clients, and it does not affect the Nextcloud server."
