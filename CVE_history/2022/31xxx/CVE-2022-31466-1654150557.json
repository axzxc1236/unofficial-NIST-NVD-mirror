      "oldValue": "Quick Heal Total Security before 12.1.1.27 has a TOCTOU race condition that leads to privilege escalation. It may follow a symlink that was created after a malware check.",
      "newValue": "Time of Check - Time of Use (TOCTOU) vulnerability in Quick Heal Total Security prior to 12.1.1.27 allows a local attacker to achieve privilege escalation, potentially leading to deletion of system files. This is achieved through exploiting the time between detecting a file as malicious and when the action of quarantining or cleaning is performed, and using the time to replace the malicious file by a symlink."
