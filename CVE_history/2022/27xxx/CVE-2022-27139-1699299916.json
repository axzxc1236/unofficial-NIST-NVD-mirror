NOTE: Vendor states that as outlined in Ghost's security documentation, upload of SVGs is only possible by trusted authenticated users. The uploading of SVG files to Ghost does not represent a remote code execution vulnerability. SVGs are not executable on the server, and may only execute javascript in a client's browser - this is expected and intentional functionality.",
