      "type": "Description",
      "oldValue": "In APache APISIX before 3.13.1, an attacker can obtain a plugin-configured secret via an error message response by sending an incorrect JSON Web Token to a route protected by the jwt-auth plugin. The error logic in the dependency library lua-resty-jwt enables sending an RS256 token to an endpoint that requires an HS256 token, with the original secret value included in the error response.",
      "newValue": "In APache APISIX before 3.13.1, the jwt-auth plugin has a security issue that leaks the user's secret key because the error message returned from the dependency lua-resty-jwt contains sensitive information."
