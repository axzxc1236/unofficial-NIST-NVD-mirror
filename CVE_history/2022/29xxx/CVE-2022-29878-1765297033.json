Affected devices use a limited range for challenges that are sent during the unencrypted challenge-response communication. An unauthenticated attacker could capture a valid challenge-response pair generated by a legitimate user, and request the webpage repeatedly to wait for the same challenge to reappear for which the correct response is known. This could allow the attacker to access the management interface of the device.",
