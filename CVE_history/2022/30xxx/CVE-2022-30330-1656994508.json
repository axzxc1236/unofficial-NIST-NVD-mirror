      "oldValue": "In the KeepKey firmware before 7.3.2, the bootloader can be exploited in unusual situations in which the attacker has physical access, convinces the victim to install malicious firmware, or has unspecified other capabilities. lib/board/supervise.c mishandles svhandler_flash_* address range checks. If exploited, any installed malware could persist even after wiping the device and resetting the firmware.",
      "newValue": "In the KeepKey firmware before 7.3.2,Flaws in the supervisor interface can be exploited to bypass important security restrictions on firmware operations. Using these flaws, malicious firmware code can elevate privileges, permanently make the device inoperable or overwrite the trusted bootloader code to compromise the hardware wallet across reboots or storage wipes."
