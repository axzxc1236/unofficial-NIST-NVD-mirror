      "newValue": "FunJSQ, a third-party module integrated on some NETGEAR routers and Orbi WiFi Systems, does not properly validate TLS certificates when downloading update packages through its auto-update mechanism. An attacker (suitably positioned on the network) could intercept the update request and deliver a malicious update package in order to gain arbitrary code execution on affected devices. This affects R6230 before 1.1.0.112, R6260 before 1.1.0.88, R7000 before 1.0.11.134, R8900 before 1.0.5.42, R9000 before 1.0.5.42, and XR300 before 1.0.3.72 and Orbi RBR20 before 2.7.2.26, RBR50 before 2.7.4.26, RBS20 before 2.7.2.26, and RBS50 before 2.7.4.26."
