Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the xupnpd_generic.lua plugin for the xupnpd service, which listens on TCP port 4044 by default. When parsing the feed parameter, the process does not properly validate a user-supplied string before using it to execute a system call. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the service account. Was ZDI-CAN-15906.",
