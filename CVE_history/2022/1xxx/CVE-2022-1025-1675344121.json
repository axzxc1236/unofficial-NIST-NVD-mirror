      "oldValue": "All unpatched versions of Argo CD starting with v1.0.0 are vulnerable to an improper access control bug, allowing a malicious user to potentially escalate their privileges to admin-level.",
      "newValue": "A privilege escalation flaw was found in ArgoCD. This flaw allows a malicious user who has push access to an application's source git or Helm repository, or sync and override access, to perform actions they are not authorized to do. For example, if the attacker has `update` or `delete` access, they can modify or delete any resource on the destination cluster and escalate ArgoCD privileges to the admin level. If the attacker has `get` access, they can view and list actions for any resource on the destination cluster except secrets and view the logs of any pods on the destination cluster. If the attacker has action/{some action or *} access on the application, they can run an action for any resource that supports the allowed action on the application's destination cluster."
