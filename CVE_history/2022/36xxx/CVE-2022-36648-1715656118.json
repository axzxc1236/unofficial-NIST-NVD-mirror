      "oldValue": "The hardware emulation in the of_dpa_cmd_add_l2_flood of rocker device model in QEMU, as used in 7.0.0 and earlier, allows remote attackers to crash the host qemu and potentially execute code on the host via execute a malformed program in the guest OS.",
      "newValue": "The hardware emulation in the of_dpa_cmd_add_l2_flood of rocker device model in QEMU, as used in 7.0.0 and earlier, allows remote attackers to crash the host qemu and potentially execute code on the host via execute a malformed program in the guest OS. Note: This has been disputed by multiple third parties as not a valid vulnerability due to the rocker device not falling within the virtualization use case."
