In versions prior to 1.3.44, anyone who uses elrond-go to process blocks (historical or actual) could encounter a `MultiESDTNFTTransfer` transaction like this: `MultiESDTNFTTransfer` with a missing function name. Basic functionality like p2p messaging, storage, API requests and such are unaffected. Version 1.3.34 contains a fix for this issue. There are no known workarounds.",
