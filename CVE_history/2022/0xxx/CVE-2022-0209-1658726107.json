    {
      "action": "Changed",
      "type": "Description",
      "oldValue": "The Mitsol Social Post Feed plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including, 1.10 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on the application id parameters. This makes it possible for authenticated (admin+) attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html is disabled.",
      "newValue": "The Mitsol Social Post Feed WordPress plugin before 1.11 does not escape some of its settings before outputting them back in attributes, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered_html capability is disallowed"
