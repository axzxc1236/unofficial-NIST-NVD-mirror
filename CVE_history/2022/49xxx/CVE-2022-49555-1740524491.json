      "newValue": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nBluetooth: hci_qca: Use del_timer_sync() before freeing\n\nWhile looking at a crash report on a timer list being corrupted, which\nusually happens when a timer is freed while still active. This is\ncommonly triggered by code calling del_timer() instead of\ndel_timer_sync() just before freeing.\n\nOne possible culprit is the hci_qca driver, which does exactly that.\n\nEric mentioned that wake_retrans_timer could be rearmed via the work\nqueue, so also move the destruction of the work queue before\ndel_timer_sync()."
