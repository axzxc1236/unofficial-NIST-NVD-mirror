      "newValue": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ngpio: Restrict usage of GPIO chip irq members before initialization\n\nGPIO chip irq members are exposed before they could be completely\ninitialized and this leads to race conditions.\n\nOne such issue was observed for the gc->irq.domain variable which\nwas accessed through the I2C interface in gpiochip_to_irq() before\nit could be initialized by gpiochip_add_irqchip(). This resulted in\nKernel NULL pointer dereference.\n\nFollowing are the logs for reference :-\n\nkernel: Call Trace:\nkernel:  gpiod_to_irq+0x53/0x70\nkernel:  acpi_dev_gpio_irq_get_by+0x113/0x1f0\nkernel:  i2c_acpi_get_irq+0xc0/0xd0\nkernel:  i2c_device_probe+0x28a/0x2a0\nkernel:  really_probe+0xf2/0x460\nkernel: RIP: 0010:gpiochip_to_irq+0x47/0xc0\n\nTo avoid such scenarios, restrict usage of GPIO chip irq members before\nthey are completely initialized."
