      "newValue": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet/sched: act_ct: fix ref leak when switching zones\n\nWhen switching zones or network namespaces without doing a ct clear in\nbetween, it is now leaking a reference to the old ct entry. That's\nbecause tcf_ct_skb_nfct_cached() returns false and\ntcf_ct_flow_table_lookup() may simply overwrite it.\n\nThe fix is to, as the ct entry is not reusable, free it already at\ntcf_ct_skb_nfct_cached()."
