It's a\nstale sysfs entry that should have been removed but remains with NULL\nops.  The commit changed the error handling to skip the entries after\na NULL con->wq, and this leaves the power device unreleased.\n\nFor addressing the regression, the straight revert is applied here.\nFurther code improvements can be done from the scratch again."
