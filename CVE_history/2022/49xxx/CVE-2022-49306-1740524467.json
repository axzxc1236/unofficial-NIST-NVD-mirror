The sysdev pointer is now used when\nassigning the ACPI companions to the xHCI ports and USB\ndevices.\n\nAssigning the ACPI companion here resulted in the\nfwnode->secondary pointer to be replaced also for the parent\ndwc3 device since the primary fwnode (the ACPI companion)\nwas shared. That was unintentional and it created potential\nside effects like resource leaks."
