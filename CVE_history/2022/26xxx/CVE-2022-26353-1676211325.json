This flaw was inadvertently introduced with the fix for CVE-2021-3748, which forgot to unmap the cached virtqueue elements on error, leading to memory leakage, use-after-free or other unexpected results. A malicious privileged guest could exploit this issue to crash QEMU or potentially execute arbitrary code within the context of the QEMU process on the host.",
