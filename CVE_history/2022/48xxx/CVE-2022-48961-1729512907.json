      "newValue": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: mdio: fix unbalanced fwnode reference count in mdio_device_release()\n\nThere is warning report about of_node refcount leak\nwhile probing mdio device:\n\nOF: ERROR: memory leak, expected refcount 1 instead of 2,\nof_node_get()/of_node_put() unbalanced - destroy cset entry:\nattach overlay node /spi/soc@0/mdio@710700c0/ethernet@4\n\nIn of_mdiobus_register_device(), we increase fwnode refcount\nby fwnode_handle_get() before associating the of_node with\nmdio device, but it has never been decreased in normal path.\nSince that, in mdio_device_release(), it needs to call\nfwnode_handle_put() in addition instead of calling kfree()\ndirectly.\n\nAfter above, just calling mdio_device_free() in the error handle\npath of of_mdiobus_register_device() is enough to keep the\nrefcount balanced."
