      "newValue": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\narm64: topology: fix possible overflow in amu_fie_setup()\n\ncpufreq_get_hw_max_freq() returns max frequency in kHz as *unsigned int*,\nwhile freq_inv_set_max_ratio() gets passed this frequency in Hz as 'u64'.\nMultiplying max frequency by 1000 can potentially result in overflow --\nmultiplying by 1000ULL instead should avoid that...\n\nFound by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with the SVACE static\nanalysis tool."
