By passing a JSON with a duplicate key, the attacker can bypass the body_schema validation in the request-validation plugin. For example, `{\"string_payload\":\"bad\",\"string_payload\":\"good\"}` can be used to hide the \"bad\" input.\n\nSystems satisfy three conditions below are affected by this attack:\n1. use body_schema validation in the request-validation plugin\n2. upstream application uses a special JSON library that chooses the first occurred value, like jsoniter or gojay\n3. upstream application does not validate the input anymore.\n\nThe fix in APISIX is to re-encode the validated JSON input back into the request body at the side of APISIX.\nImproper Input Validation vulnerability in __COMPONENT__ of Apache APISIX allows an attacker to __IMPACT__.  This issue affects Apache APISIX Apache APISIX version 2.12.1 and prior versions.",
