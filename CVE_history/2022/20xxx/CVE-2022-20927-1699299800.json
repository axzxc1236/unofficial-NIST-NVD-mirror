      "oldValue": "A vulnerability in the SSL/TLS client of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to improper memory management when a device initiates SSL/TLS connections. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by ensuring that the device will connect to an SSL/TLS server that is using specific encryption parameters. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to unexpectedly reload, resulting in a DoS condition.",
