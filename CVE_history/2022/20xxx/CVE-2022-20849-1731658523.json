An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a sequence of specific PPPoE packets from controlled customer premises equipment (CPE). A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the PPPoE process to continually restart, resulting in a denial of service condition (DoS).Cisco&nbsp;has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.This advisory is part of the September 2022 release of the Cisco&nbsp;IOS XR Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication.
