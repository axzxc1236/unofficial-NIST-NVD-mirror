      "newValue": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nASoC: sof_es8336: fix possible use-after-free in sof_es8336_remove()\n\nsof_es8336_remove() calls cancel_delayed_work(). However, that\nfunction does not wait until the work function finishes. This\nmeans that the callback function may still be running after\nthe driver's remove function has finished, which would result\nin a use-after-free.\n\nFix by calling cancel_delayed_work_sync(), which ensures that\nthe work is properly cancelled, no longer running, and unable\nto re-schedule itself."
