      "newValue": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbpf, x86: fix freeing of not-finalized bpf_prog_pack\n\nsyzbot reported a few issues with bpf_prog_pack [1], [2]. This only happens\nwith multiple subprogs. In jit_subprogs(), we first call bpf_int_jit_compile()\non each sub program. And then, we call it on each sub program again. jit_data\nis not freed in the first call of bpf_int_jit_compile(). Similarly we don't\ncall bpf_jit_binary_pack_finalize() in the first call of bpf_int_jit_compile().\n\nIf bpf_int_jit_compile() failed for one sub program, we will call\nbpf_jit_binary_pack_finalize() for this sub program. However, we don't have a\nchance to call it for other sub programs. Then we will hit \"goto out_free\" in\njit_subprogs(), and call bpf_jit_free on some subprograms that haven't got\nbpf_jit_binary_pack_finalize() yet.\n\nAt this point, bpf_jit_binary_pack_free() is called and the whole 2MB page is\nfreed erroneously.\n\nFix this with a custom bpf_jit_free() for x86_64, which calls\nbpf_jit_binary_pack_finalize() if necessary. Also, with custom\nbpf_jit_free(), bpf_prog_aux->use_bpf_prog_pack is not needed any more,\nremove it.\n\n[1] https://syzkaller.appspot.com/bug?extid=2f649ec6d2eea1495a8f\n[2] https://syzkaller.appspot.com/bug?extid=87f65c75f4a72db05445"
