      "newValue": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnfc: pn533: Fix use-after-free bugs caused by pn532_cmd_timeout\n\nWhen the pn532 uart device is detaching, the pn532_uart_remove()\nis called. But there are no functions in pn532_uart_remove() that\ncould delete the cmd_timeout timer, which will cause use-after-free\nbugs. The process is shown below:\n\n    (thread 1)                  |        (thread 2)\n                                |  pn532_uart_send_frame\npn532_uart_remove               |    mod_timer(&pn532->cmd_timeout,...)\n  ...                           |    (wait a time)\n  kfree(pn532) //FREE           |    pn532_cmd_timeout\n                                |      pn532_uart_send_frame\n                                |        pn532->... //USE\n\nThis patch adds del_timer_sync() in pn532_uart_remove() in order to\nprevent the use-after-free bugs. What's more, the pn53x_unregister_nfc()\nis well synchronized, it sets nfc_dev->shutting_down to true and there\nare no syscalls could restart the cmd_timeout timer."
