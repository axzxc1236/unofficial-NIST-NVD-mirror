      "newValue": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnetfilter: nf_tables: do not allow SET_ID to refer to another table\n\nWhen doing lookups for sets on the same batch by using its ID, a set from a\ndifferent table can be used.\n\nThen, when the table is removed, a reference to the set may be kept after\nthe set is freed, leading to a potential use-after-free.\n\nWhen looking for sets by ID, use the table that was used for the lookup by\nname, and only return sets belonging to that same table.\n\nThis fixes CVE-2022-2586, also reported as ZDI-CAN-17470."
