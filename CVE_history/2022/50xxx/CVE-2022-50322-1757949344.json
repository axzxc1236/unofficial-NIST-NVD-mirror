      "newValue": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nrtc: msc313: Fix function prototype mismatch in msc313_rtc_probe()\n\nWith clang's kernel control flow integrity (kCFI, CONFIG_CFI_CLANG),\nindirect call targets are validated against the expected function\npointer prototype to make sure the call target is valid to help mitigate\nROP attacks. If they are not identical, there is a failure at run time,\nwhich manifests as either a kernel panic or thread getting killed.\n\nmsc313_rtc_probe() was passing clk_disable_unprepare() directly, which\ndid not have matching prototypes for devm_add_action_or_reset()'s\ncallback argument. Refactor to use devm_clk_get_enabled() instead.\n\nThis was found as a result of Clang's new -Wcast-function-type-strict\nflag, which is more sensitive than the simpler -Wcast-function-type,\nwhich only checks for type width mismatches."
