      "newValue": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrbd: only clone bio if we have a backing device\n\nCommit c347a787e34cb (drbd: set ->bi_bdev in drbd_req_new) moved a\nbio_set_dev call (which has since been removed) to \"earlier\", from\ndrbd_request_prepare to drbd_req_new.\n\nThe problem is that this accesses device->ldev->backing_bdev, which is\nnot NULL-checked at this point. When we don't have an ldev (i.e. when\nthe DRBD device is diskless), this leads to a null pointer deref.\n\nSo, only allocate the private_bio if we actually have a disk. This is\nalso a small optimization, since we don't clone the bio to only to\nimmediately free it again in the diskless case."
