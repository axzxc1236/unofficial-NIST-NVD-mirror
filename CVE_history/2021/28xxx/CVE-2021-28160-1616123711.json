      "oldValue": "Reflected XSS on Acexy (BoyaMicro) Wireless-N WiFi Repeater 28.08.06.1 version 1.0 devices can occur via a malformed SSID field during scanning for nearby access points, which also occurs when a device's user visits the Repeater Wizard web management section. This enables an attacker to steal LAN credentials without being connected to the device.",
      "newValue": "Wireless-N WiFi Repeater REV 1.0 (28.08.06.1) suffers from a reflected XSS vulnerability due to unsanitized SSID value when the latter is displayed in the /repeater.html page (\"Repeater Wizard\" homepage section)."
