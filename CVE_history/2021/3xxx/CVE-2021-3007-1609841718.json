NOTE: the code may be related to Laminas Project laminas-http. Zend Framework is no longer supported by the maintainer. However, not all Zend Framework 3.0.0 vulnerabilities exist in a Laminas Project release.",

NOTE: Zend Framework is no longer supported by the maintainer. NOTE: the laminas-http vendor considers this a \"vulnerability in the PHP language itself\" but has added certain type checking as a way to prevent exploitation in (unrecommended) use cases where attacker-supplied data can be deserialized."
