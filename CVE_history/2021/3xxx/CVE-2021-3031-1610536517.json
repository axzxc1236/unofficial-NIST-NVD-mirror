This leaks a small amount of random information from the firewall memory into the Ethernet packets. An attacker on the same Ethernet subnet as the PAN-OS firewall is able to collect potentially sensitive information from these packets.\n\nThis issue is also known as Etherleak and is detected by security scanners as CVE-2003-0001.\nThis issue impacts:\nPAN-OS 8.1 version earlier than PAN-OS 8.1.18;\nPAN-OS 9.0 versions earlier than PAN-OS 9.0.12;\nPAN-OS 9.1 versions earlier than PAN-OS 9.1.5.",
