Although the element control lists a fixed set of possible html tags, it is possible for a user with Contributor or above permissions to send a modified â€˜save_builderâ€™ request containing JavaScript in the â€˜html_tagâ€™ parameter, which is not filtered and is output without escaping. This JavaScript will then be executed when the saved page is viewed or previewed.",
