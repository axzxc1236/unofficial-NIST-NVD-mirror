      "oldValue": "This vulnerability allows local attackers to delete arbitrary directories on affected installations of Avast Premium Security 20.8.2429 (Build 20.8.5653.561). An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the AvastSvc.exe module. By creating a directory junction, an attacker can abuse the service to delete a directory. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to create a denial-of-service condition on the system. Was ZDI-CAN-12082.",
