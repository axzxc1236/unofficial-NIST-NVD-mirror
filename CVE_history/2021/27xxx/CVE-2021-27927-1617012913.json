The code inside this controller calls diableSIDValidation inside the init() method.",

The code inside this controller calls diableSIDValidation inside the init() method. An attacker doesn't have to know Zabbix user login credentials, but has to know the correct Zabbix URL and contact information of an existing user with sufficient privileges."
