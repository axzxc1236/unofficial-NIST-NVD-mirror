      "oldValue": "The command “ipfilter” in Brocade Fabric OS before Brocade Fabric OS v.9.0.1a, v8.2.3, and v8.2.0_CBN4, and v7.4.2h uses unsafe string function to process user input. Authenticated attackers can abuse this vulnerability to exploit stack-based buffer overflows, allowing execution of arbitrary code as the root user account.",
      "newValue": "The request handling functions in web management interface of Brocade Fabric OS versions before v9.0.1a, v8.2.3a, and v7.4.2h do not properly handle malformed user input, resulting in a service crash. An authenticated attacker could use this weakness to cause the FOS HTTP application handler to crash, requiring a reboot."
