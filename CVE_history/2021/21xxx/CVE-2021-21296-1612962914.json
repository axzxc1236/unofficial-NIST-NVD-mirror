In Fleet before version 3.7.0 a malicious actor with a valid node key can send a badly formatted request that causes the Fleet server to exit, resulting in denial of service. This is possible only while a live query is currently ongoing. We believe the impact of this vulnerability to be low given the requirement that the actor has a valid node key. There is no information disclosure, privilege escalation, or code execution.\n\nThe issue is fixed in Fleet 3.7.0.",
