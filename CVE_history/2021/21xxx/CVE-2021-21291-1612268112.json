For example, if a whitelist domain was configured for \".example.com\", the intention is that subdomains of example.com are allowed. Instead, \"example.com\" and \"badexample.com\" could also match.\n\nThis is fixed in version 7.0.0 onwards.  As a workaround, one can disable the whitelist domain feature and run separate OAuth2 Proxy instances for each subdomain.\n\n\n\n\n\n",
