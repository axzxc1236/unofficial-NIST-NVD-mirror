In TYPO3 before versions 9.5.25, 10.4.14, 11.1.1 requesting invalid or non-existing resources via HTTP triggers the page error handler which again could retrieve content  to be shown as error message from another page. This leads to a scenario in which the application is calling itself recursively - amplifying the impact of the initial attack until the limits of the web server are exceeded. This is fixed in versions 9.5.25, 10.4.14, 11.1.1.",
