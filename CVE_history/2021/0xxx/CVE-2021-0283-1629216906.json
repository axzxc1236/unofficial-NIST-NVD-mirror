      "oldValue": "A buffer overflow vulnerability in the TCP/IP stack of Juniper Networks Junos OS allows an attacker to send specific sequences of packets to the device thereby causing a Denial of Service (DoS).\n\nBy repeatedly sending these sequences of packets to the device, an attacker can sustain the Denial of Service (DoS) condition.\n\nThe device will abnormally shut down as a result of these sent packets.  A potential indicator of compromise will be the following message in the log files:\n  \"eventd[13955]: SYSTEM_ABNORMAL_SHUTDOWN: System abnormally shut down\"\n\nThese issue are only triggered by traffic destined to the device.
