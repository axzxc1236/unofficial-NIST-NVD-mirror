Continued receipt and processing of these frames, sent from the local broadcast domain, will repeatedly crash the l2cpd process and sustain the Denial of Service (DoS) condition.\n\nThis issue affects:\nJuniper Networks Junos OS:\n12.3 versions prior to 12.3R12-S18;\n15.1 versions prior to 15.1R7-S9;\n17.3 versions prior to 17.3R3-S12;\n17.4 versions prior to 17.4R2-S13, 17.4R3-S5;\n18.1 versions prior to 18.1R3-S13;\n18.2 versions prior to 18.2R3-S8;\n18.3 versions prior to 18.3R3-S5;\n18.4 versions prior to 18.4R2-S8, 18.4R3-S8;\n19.1 versions prior to 19.1R3-S5;\n19.2 versions prior to 19.2R3-S3;\n19.3 versions prior to 19.3R2-S6, 19.3R3-S2;\n19.4 versions prior to 19.4R1-S4, 19.4R2-S4, 19.4R3-S3;\n20.1 versions prior to 20.1R2-S2, 20.1R3;\n20.2 versions prior to 20.2R3-S1;\n20.3 versions prior to 20.3R2-S1, 20.3R3;\n20.4 versions prior to 20.4R2.\n\nJuniper Networks Junos OS Evolved versions prior to 20.4R2-EVO.",
