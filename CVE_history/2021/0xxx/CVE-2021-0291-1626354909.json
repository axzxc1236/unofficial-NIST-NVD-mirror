A high rate of specific traffic may lead to a partial Denial of Service (DoS) as the CPU utilization of the RE is significantly increased.\n\nThe SNMP Agent Extensibility (agentx) process should only be listening to TCP port 705 on the internal routing instance. External connections destined to port 705 should not be allowed.\n\nThis issue affects:\nJuniper Networks Junos OS:\n15.1 versions prior to 15.1R7-S9;\n17.3 versions prior to 17.3R3-S12;\n17.4 versions prior to 17.4R2-S13, 17.4R3-S5;\n18.3 versions prior to 18.3R3-S5;\n18.4 versions prior to 18.4R2-S8;\n19.1 versions prior to 19.1R3-S5;\n19.2 versions prior to 19.2R3-S2;\n19.3 versions prior to 19.3R2-S6, 19.3R3-S2;\n19.4 versions prior to 19.4R1-S4, 19.4R2-S4, 19.4R3;\n20.1 versions prior to 20.1R2;\n20.2 versions prior to 20.2R2;\n20.3 versions prior to 20.3R2.\n\nJuniper Networks Junos OS Evolved versions prior to 20.3R2-EVO.\n\n\nThis issue does not affect Juniper Networks Junos OS versions prior to 13.2R1.\n",
