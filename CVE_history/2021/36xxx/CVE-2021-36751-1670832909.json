    {
      "action": "Changed",
      "type": "Description",
      "oldValue": "ENC DataVault 7.1.1W uses an inappropriate encryption algorithm, such that an attacker (who does not know the secret key) can make ciphertext modifications that are reflected in modified plaintext. There is no data integrity mechanism. (This behavior occurs across USB drives sold under multiple brand names.)",
      "newValue": "ENC DataVault 7.2.3 and before, and OEM versions, use an encryption algorithm that is vulnerable to data manipulation (without knowledge of the key). This is called ciphertext malleability. There is no data integrity mechanism to detect this manipulation."
