An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious data to the vDaemon listening service on the affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a buffer overflow condition on the affected system, which could allow the attacker to cause the vDaemon listening service to reload and result in a DoS condition.Cisco&nbsp;has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability."
