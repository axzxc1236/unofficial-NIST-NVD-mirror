An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a large number of crafted TCP packets to the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the web management interface to become unavailable, resulting in a DoS condition.\r Note: This vulnerability does not impact traffic that is going through the device or going to the Management Ethernet interface of the device.\r ",
