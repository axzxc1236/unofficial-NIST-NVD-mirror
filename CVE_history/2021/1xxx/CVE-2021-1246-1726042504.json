An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by accessing a crafted URL. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to obtain access to a section of the interface, which they could use to obtain potentially confidential information and create arbitrary XML files.\r\nCisco&nbsp;has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability."
