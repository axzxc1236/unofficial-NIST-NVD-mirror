      "oldValue": "User-writable pre and post-install scripts unpacked during the Zoom Client for Meetings for MacOS installation before version 5.2.0 allow for privilege escalation to root.",

In the affected products listed below, a malicious actor with local access to a user's machine could use this flaw to potentially run arbitrary system commands in a higher privileged context during the installation process."
