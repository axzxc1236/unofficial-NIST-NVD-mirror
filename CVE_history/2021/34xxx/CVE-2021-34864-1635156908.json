An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target guest system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the WinAppHelper component. The issue results from the lack of proper access control. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of the hypervisor.
