      "oldValue": "Amazon FreeRTOS 10.2.0 through 10.4.5 on the ARMv7-M and ARMv8-M MPU platforms does not prevent non-kernel code from calling the xPortRaisePrivilege and vPortResetPrivilege internal functions. This is fixed in 10.4.6 and in 10.4.3-LTS Patch 2.",
      "newValue": "FreeRTOS versions 10.2.0 through 10.4.5 do not prevent non-kernel code from calling the xPortRaisePrivilege internal function to raise privilege. FreeRTOS versions through 10.4.6 do not prevent a third party that has already independently gained the ability to execute injected code to achieve further privilege escalation by branching directly inside a FreeRTOS MPU API wrapper function with a manually crafted stack frame. These issues affect ARMv7-M MPU ports, and ARMv8-M ports with MPU support enabled (i.e. configENABLE_MPU set to 1). These are fixed in V10.5.0 and in V10.4.3-LTS Patch 3."
