By manipulating variables that reference files with â€œdot-dot-slash (../)â€? sequences and its variations or by using absolute file paths, it may be possible to access arbitrary files and directories stored on file system including application source code or configuration and critical system files. The vulnerability issue is resolved in Aim v3.1.0.",
