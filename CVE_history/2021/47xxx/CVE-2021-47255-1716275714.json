      "newValue": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nkvm: LAPIC: Restore guard to prevent illegal APIC register access\n\nPer the SDM, \"any access that touches bytes 4 through 15 of an APIC\nregister may cause undefined behavior and must not be executed.\"\nWorse, such an access in kvm_lapic_reg_read can result in a leak of\nkernel stack contents. Prior to commit 01402cf81051 (\"kvm: LAPIC:\nwrite down valid APIC registers\"), such an access was explicitly\ndisallowed. Restore the guard that was removed in that commit."
