      "newValue": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nKVM: SVM: Use online_vcpus, not created_vcpus, to iterate over vCPUs\n\nUse the kvm_for_each_vcpu() helper to iterate over vCPUs when encrypting\nVMSAs for SEV, which effectively switches to use online_vcpus instead of\ncreated_vcpus.  This fixes a possible null-pointer dereference as\ncreated_vcpus does not guarantee a vCPU exists, since it is updated at\nthe very beginning of KVM_CREATE_VCPU.  created_vcpus exists to allow the\nbulk of vCPU creation to run in parallel, while still correctly\nrestricting the max number of max vCPUs."
