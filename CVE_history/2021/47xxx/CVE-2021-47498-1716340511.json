      "newValue": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndm rq: don't queue request to blk-mq during DM suspend\n\nDM uses blk-mq's quiesce/unquiesce to stop/start device mapper queue.\n\nBut blk-mq's unquiesce may come from outside events, such as elevator\nswitch, updating nr_requests or others, and request may come during\nsuspend, so simply ask for blk-mq to requeue it.\n\nFixes one kernel panic issue when running updating nr_requests and\ndm-mpath suspend/resume stress test."
