      "newValue": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nphy: mdio: fix memory leak\n\nSyzbot reported memory leak in MDIO bus interface, the problem was in\nwrong state logic.\n\nMDIOBUS_ALLOCATED indicates 2 states:\n\t1. Bus is only allocated\n\t2. Bus allocated and __mdiobus_register() fails, but\n\t   device_register() was called\n\nIn case of device_register() has been called we should call put_device()\nto correctly free the memory allocated for this device, but mdiobus_free()\ncalls just kfree(dev) in case of MDIOBUS_ALLOCATED state\n\nTo avoid this behaviour we need to set bus->state to MDIOBUS_UNREGISTERED\n_before_ calling device_register(), because put_device() should be\ncalled even in case of device_register() failure."
