      "newValue": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\niommu/vt-d: Remove WO permissions on second-level paging entries\n\nWhen the first level page table is used for IOVA translation, it only\nsupports Read-Only and Read-Write permissions. The Write-Only permission\nis not supported as the PRESENT bit (implying Read permission) should\nalways set. When using second level, we still give separate permissions\nthat allows WriteOnly which seems inconsistent and awkward. We want to\nhave consistent behavior. After moving to 1st level, we don't want things\nto work sometimes, and break if we use 2nd level for the same mappings.\nHence remove this configuration."
