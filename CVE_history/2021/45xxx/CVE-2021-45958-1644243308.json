NOTE: multiple third parties dispute whether this is a confirmed finding, because the event that caused the Reproducer Testcase to stop indicating a buffer overflow was a change to the AFLplusplus project (5525f8c9ef8bb879dadd0eb942d524827d1b0362), not a change to the UltraJSON project.",
      "newValue": "UltraJSON (aka ujson) through 5.1.0 has a stack-based buffer overflow in Buffer_AppendIndentUnchecked (called from encode). Exploitation can, for example, use a large amount of indentation."
