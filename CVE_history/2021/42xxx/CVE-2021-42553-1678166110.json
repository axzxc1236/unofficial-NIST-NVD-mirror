      "newValue": "A buffer overflow vulnerability in stm32_mw_usb_host of STMicroelectronics in versions before 3.5.1 allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code when the descriptor contains more endpoints than USBH_MAX_NUM_ENDPOINTS. The library is typically integrated when using a RTOS such as FreeRTOS on STM32 MCUs."
