A large amount of page moves within a short space of time could overwhelm Database servers due to improper handling of load balancing and a lack of an appropriate index. No patches are currently available. As a workaround, one may avoid use of the extension unless additional rate limit at the MediaWiki level or via PoolCounter / MySQL is enabled.",
