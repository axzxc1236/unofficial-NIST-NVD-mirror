Authentication between Atlassian products and the Atlassian Connect Express app occurs with a server-to-server JWT or a context JWT. Atlassian Connect Express versions between 3.0.2 - 6.5.0 erroneously accept context JWTs in lifecycle endpoints (such as installation) where only server-to-server JWTs should be accepted, permitting an attacker to send authenticated re-installation events to an app.",
