      "action": "Changed",
      "type": "Description",
      "oldValue": "Apostrophe CMS versions between 2.63.0 to 3.3.1 affected by an insufficient session expiration vulnerability, which allows unauthenticated remote attackers to hijack recently logged-in users' sessions.",
      "newValue": "Apostrophe CMS versions prior to 3.3.1 did not invalidate existing login sessions when disabling a user account or changing the password, creating a situation in which a device compromised by a third party could not be locked out by those means. As a mitigation for older releases the user account in question can be archived (3.x) or moved to the trash (2.x and earlier) which does disable the existing session."
