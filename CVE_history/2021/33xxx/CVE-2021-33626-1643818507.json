      "oldValue": "In the kernel in Insyde InsydeH2O 5.x, certain SMM drivers did not correctly validate the CommBuffer and CommBufferSize parameters, allowing callers to corrupt either the firmware or the OS memory. The fixed versions for this issue in the PnpSmm, SmmResourceCheckDxe, and BeepStatusCode drivers are 05.08.23, 05.16.23, 05.26.23, 05.35.23, 05.43.23, and 05.51.23 (for Kernel 5.0 through 5.5).",
      "newValue": "A vulnerability exists in SMM (System Management Mode) branch that registers a SWSMI handler that does not sufficiently check or validate the allocated buffer pointer(QWORD values for CommBuffer). This can be used by an attacker to corrupt data in SMRAM memory and even lead to arbitrary code execution."
