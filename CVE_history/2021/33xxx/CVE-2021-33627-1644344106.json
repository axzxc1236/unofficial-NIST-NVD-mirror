      "oldValue": "A vulnerability exists in SMM (System Management Mode) branch that registers a SWSMI handler that does not sufficiently check or validate the allocated buffer pointer(CommBuffer). This can be used by an attacker to corrupt data in SMRAM memory and even lead to arbitrary code execution.",
      "newValue": "An issue was discovered in Insyde InsydeH2O 5.x, affecting FwBlockServiceSmm. Software SMI services that use the Communicate() function of the EFI_SMM_COMMUNICATION_PROTOCOL do not check whether the address of the buffer is valid, which allows use of SMRAM, MMIO, or OS kernel addresses"
