      "oldValue": "A security issue was discovered in the Kubernetes Image Builder where default credentials are enabled during the image build process. Additionally, virtual machine images built using the Nutanix or the OVA provider do not disable these default credentials, and nodes using the resulting images may be accessible via these default credentials. The credentials can be used to gain root access. Kubernetes clusters are only affected if their Windows nodes use VM images created via the Image Builder project with its Nutanix or OVA provider.",
      "newValue": "A security issue was discovered in the Kubernetes Image Builder where default credentials are enabled during the Windows image build process when using the Nutanix or VMware OVA providers. These credentials, which allow root access, are disabled at the conclusion of the build. Kubernetes clusters are only affected if their nodes use VM images created via the Image Builder project and the vulnerability was exploited during the build process, which requires an attacker to access the build VM and modify the image while the build is in progress."
