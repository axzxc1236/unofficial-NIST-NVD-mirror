      "newValue": "The GiveWP â€“ Donation Plugin and Fundraising Platform plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the donor notes parameter in all versions up to, and including, 4.5.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with GiveWP worker-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. Additionally, they need to trick an administrator into visiting the legacy version of the site."
