      "newValue": "The Restrict File Access plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.2. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the 'restrict-file-access' page. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php), via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link."
