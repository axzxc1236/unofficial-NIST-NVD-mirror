      "type": "Description",
      "newValue": "The Dataverse Integration plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Privilege Escalation due to missing authorization checks within its reset_password_link REST endpoint in versions 2.77 through 2.81. The endpointâ€™s handler accepts a client-supplied id, email, or login, looks up that user, and calls get_password_reset_key() unconditionally. Because it only checks that the caller is authenticated, and not that they own or may edit the target account, any authenticated attacker, with Subscriber-level access and above, can obtain a password reset link for an administrator and hijack that account."
