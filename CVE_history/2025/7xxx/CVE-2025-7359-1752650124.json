      "newValue": "The Counter live visitors for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due to insufficient file path validation in the wcvisitor_get_block function in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.6. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary files on the server. NOTE: This particular vulnerability deletes all the files in a targeted arbitrary directory rather than a specified arbitrary file, which can lead to loss of data or a denial of service condition."
