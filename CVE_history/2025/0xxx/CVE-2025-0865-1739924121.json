      "newValue": "The WP Media Category Management plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions 2.0 to 2.3.3. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the wp_mcm_handle_action_settings() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to alter plugin settings, such as the taxonomy used for media, the base slug for media categories, and the default media category via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link."
