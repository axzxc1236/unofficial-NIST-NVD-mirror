This issue affects all versions and could enable an attacker to overwrite any file in the bucket. As users download binary files such as JARs from this bucket, this vulnerability could lead to remote code execution (RCE) on any user who uses the application. Additionally, an attacker could modify the documentation to include malicious download links."
