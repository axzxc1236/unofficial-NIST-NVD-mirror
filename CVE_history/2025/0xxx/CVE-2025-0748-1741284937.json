      "newValue": "The Homey theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.4.3. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the 'homey_verify_user_manually' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update verify an user via a forged request, granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link."
