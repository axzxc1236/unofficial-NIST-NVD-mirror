      "newValue": "The Uncanny Automator – Easy Automation, Integration, Webhooks & Workflow Builder Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the automator_discord_user_mapping shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 6.10.0.2 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on the verified_message parameter. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user with a verified Discord account accesses the injected page."
