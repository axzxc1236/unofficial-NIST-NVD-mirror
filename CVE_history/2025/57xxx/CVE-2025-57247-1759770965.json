      "newValue": "The BATBToken smart contract (address 0xfbf1388408670c02f0dbbb74251d8ded1d63b7a2, Compiler Version v0.8.26+commit.8a97fa7a) contains incorrect access control implementation in whitelist management functions. The setColdWhiteList() and setSpecialAddress() functions in the base ERC20 contract are declared as public without proper access control modifiers, allowing any user to bypass transfer restrictions and manipulate special address settings. This enables unauthorized users to circumvent cold time transfer restrictions and potentially disrupt dividend distribution mechanisms, leading to privilege escalation and violation of the contract's intended tokenomics."
