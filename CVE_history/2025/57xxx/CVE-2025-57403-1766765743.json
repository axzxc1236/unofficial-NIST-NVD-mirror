      "newValue": "Cola Dnslog v1.3.2 is vulnerable to Directory Traversal. When a DNS query for a TXT record is processed, the application concatenates the requested URL (or a portion of it) directly with a base path using os.path.join. This bypass allows directory traversal or absolute path injection, leading to the potential exposure of sensitive information."
