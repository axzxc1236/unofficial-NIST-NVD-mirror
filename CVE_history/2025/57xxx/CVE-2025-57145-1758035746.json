      "newValue": "A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the search-autootaxi.php endpoint of the ATSMS web application. The application fails to properly sanitize user input submitted through a form field, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code. The malicious payload is stored in the backend and executed when a user or administrator accesses the affected report page. This allows attackers to exfiltrate session cookies, hijack user sessions, and perform unauthorized actions in the context of the victims browser."
