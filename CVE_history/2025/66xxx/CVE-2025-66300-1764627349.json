      "newValue": "Grav is a file-based Web platform. Prior to 1.8.0-beta.27, A low privilege user account with page editing privilege can read any server files using \"Frontmatter\" form. This includes Grav user account files (/grav/user/accounts/*.yaml), which store hashed user password, 2FA secret, and the password reset token. This can allow an adversary to compromise any registered account by resetting a password for a user to get access to the password reset token from the file or by cracking the hashed password. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.8.0-beta.27."
