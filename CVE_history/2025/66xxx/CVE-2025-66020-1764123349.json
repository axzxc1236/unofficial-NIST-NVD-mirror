In versions from 0.31.0 to 1.1.0, the EMOJI_REGEX used in the emoji action is vulnerable to a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) attack. A short, maliciously crafted string (e.g., <100 characters) can cause the regex engine to consume excessive CPU time (minutes), leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) for the application. This issue has been patched in version 1.2.0."
