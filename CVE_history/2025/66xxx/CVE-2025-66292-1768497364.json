      "newValue": "DPanel is an open source server management panel written in Go. Prior to 1.9.2, DPanel has an arbitrary file deletion vulnerability in the /api/common/attach/delete interface. Authenticated users can delete arbitrary files on the server via path traversal. When a user logs into the administrative backend, this interface can be used to delete files. The vulnerability lies in the Delete function within the app/common/http/controller/attach.go file. The path parameter submitted by the user is directly passed to storage.Local{}.GetSaveRealPath and subsequently to os.Remove without proper sanitization or checking for path traversal characters (../). And the helper function in common/service/storage/local.go uses filepath.Join, which resolves ../ but does not enforce a chroot/jail. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.9.2."
