      "newValue": "HAX CMS PHP allows users to manage their microsite universe with a PHP backend. Prior to version 11.0.0, in the HAX site editor, users can create a website block to load another site in an iframe. The application allows users to supply a target URL in the website block. When the HAX site is visited, the client's browser will query the supplied URL. An authenticated attacker can create a HAX site with a website block pointing at an attacker-controlled server running Responder or a similar tool. The attacker can then conduct a phishing attack by convincing another user to visit their malicious HAX site to harvest credentials. Version 11.0.0 contains a patch for the issue."
