      "newValue": "An uncontrolled search path vulnerability in the Trend Micro Worry-Free Business Security Services (WFBSS) agent could have allowed an attacker with physical access to a machine to execute arbitrary code on affected installations.\r\n\r\nAn attacker must have had physical access to the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability due to need to access a certain hardware component.\r\n\r\nAlso note: this vulnerability only affected the SaaS client version of WFBSS only, meaning the on-premise version of Worry-Free Business Security was not affected, and this issue was addressed in a previous WFBSS monthly maintenance update. Therefore no other customer action is required to mitigate if the WFBSS agents are on the regular SaaS maintenance deployment schedule and this disclosure is for informational purposes only."
