These scripts may be used to escalate privileges within the application or compromise sensitive user data. Exploitation of this issue requires user interaction in that a victim must browse to the page containing the vulnerable field. Scope is changed.",

A successful attacker can abuse this to achieve session takeover, increasing the confidentiality and integrity impact as high.
