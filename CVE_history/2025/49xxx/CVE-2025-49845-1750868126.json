Only users that belong to groups specified in the site setting are allowed to view posts typed `whisper`. However, it has been discovered that users of versions prior to 3.4.6 on the `stable` branch and prior to 3.5.0.beta8-dev on the `tests-passed` branch can continue to see their own whispers even after losing visibility of posts typed `whisper`. This issue is patched in versions 3.4.6 and 3.5.0.beta8-dev. No known workarounds are available."
