      "oldValue": "In Bandisoft Bandizip through 7.37, there is a Mark-of-the-Web Bypass Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows attackers to bypass the Mark-of-the-Web protection mechanism on affected installations of Bandizip. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the handling of archived files. When extracting files from a crafted archive that bears the Mark-of-the-Web, Bandizip does not propagate the Mark-of-the-Web to the extracted files. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user.",

An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. NOTE: this is disputed because Mark-of-the-Web propagation can increase risk via security-warning habituation, and because the intended control sphere for file-origin metadata (e.g., HostUrl in Zone.Identifier) may be narrower than that for reading the file's content."
