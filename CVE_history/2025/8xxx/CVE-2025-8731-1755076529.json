      "newValue": "A vulnerability was identified in TRENDnet TI-G160i, TI-PG102i and TPL-430AP up to 20250724. This affects an unknown part of the component SSH Service. The manipulation leads to use of default credentials. It is possible to initiate the attack remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The real existence of this vulnerability is still doubted at the moment. The vendor explains: \"For product TI-PG102i and TI-G160i, by default, the product's remote management options are all disabled. The root account is for troubleshooting purpose and the password is encrypted. However, we will remove the root account from the next firmware release. For product TPL-430AP, the initial setup process requires user to set the password for the management GUI. Once that was done, the default password will be invalid.\""
