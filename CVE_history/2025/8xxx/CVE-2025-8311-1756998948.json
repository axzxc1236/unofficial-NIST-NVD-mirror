      "newValue": "dotCMS versions 24.03.22 and after, identified a Boolean-based blind SQLi vulnerability in the /api/v1/contenttype endpoint. This endpoint uses the sites query parameter, which accepts a comma-separated list of site identifiers or keys.\n\nThe vulnerability was triggered via the sites parameter, which was directly concatenated into a SQL query without proper sanitization. \n\nExploitation allowed an authenticated attacker with low privileges to extract data from database, perform privilege escalation, or trigger denial-of-service conditions. \n\nThe vulnerability was verified using tools such as SQLMap and confirmed to allow full database exfiltration and potential denial-of-service conditions via crafted payloads.\n\nThe vulnerability is fixed in the following versions of dotCMS stack: 25.08.14 / 25.07.10-1v2 LTS / 24.12.27v10 LTS / 24.04.24v21 LTS"
