      "newValue": "Invoice Ninja's configuration on macOS, specifically the presence of entitlement \"com.apple.security.get-task-allow\", allows local attackers with unprivileged access (e.g. via a malicious application) to attach a debugger, read or modify the process memory, inject code in the application's context despite being signed with Hardened Runtime and bypass Transparency, Consent, and Control (TCC). Acquired resource access is limited to previously granted permissions by the user. Access to other resources beyond granted permissions requires user interaction with a system prompt asking for permission.\n\nAccording to Apple documentation, when a non-root user runs an app with the debugging tool entitlement, the system presents an authorization dialog asking for a system administrator's credentials. Since there is no prompt when the target process has \"get-task-allow\" entitlement, the presence of this entitlement was decided to be treated as a vulnerability because it removes one step needed to perform an attack.\n\n\nThis issue was fixed in version 5.0.175"
