      "oldValue": "All versions of the package bun are vulnerable to Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection') in the $ shell API due to improper neutralization of user input. An attacker can exploit this by providing specially crafted input that includes command-line arguments or shell metacharacters, leading to unintended command execution.",
      "newValue": "Versions of the package bun after 0.0.12 are vulnerable to Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection') in the $ shell API due to improper neutralization of user input. An attacker can exploit this by providing specially crafted input that includes command-line arguments or shell metacharacters, leading to unintended command execution.\r\r**Note:** This issue relates to the widely known and actively developed 'Bun' JavaScript runtime. The bun package on NPM at versions 0.0.12 and below belongs to a different and older project that happened to claim the 'bun' name in the past."
