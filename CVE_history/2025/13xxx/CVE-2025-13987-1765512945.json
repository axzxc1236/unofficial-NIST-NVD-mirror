      "newValue": "The Purchase and Expense Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.2. This is due to missing nonce validation on the 'sup_pt_handle_deletion' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary purchase records via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link."
