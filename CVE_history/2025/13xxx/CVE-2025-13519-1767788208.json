      "newValue": "The SVG Map Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.0. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on multiple AJAX actions including 'save_data', 'delete_data', and 'add_popup'. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update the plugin's settings, delete map data, and inject malicious web scripts via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link."
