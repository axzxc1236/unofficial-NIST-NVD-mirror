This is due to missing nonce validation on multiple administrative functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to create, update, or delete employee records, departments, designations, salary grades, education records, and salary payments via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link."
