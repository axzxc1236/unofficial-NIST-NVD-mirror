      "newValue": "The Latest Registered Users plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized user data export in all versions up to, and including, 1.4. This is due to missing authorization and nonce validation in the rnd_handle_form_submit function hooked to both admin_post_my_simple_form and admin_post_nopriv_my_simple_form actions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to export complete user details (excluding passwords and sensitive tokens) in CSV format via the 'action' parameter."
