      "newValue": "The Thai Lottery Widget plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the `thailottery` shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 2.5. This is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on the user supplied `width` and `height` shortcode attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page."
