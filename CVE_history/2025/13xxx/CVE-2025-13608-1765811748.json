      "newValue": "The CC Child Pages plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the 'child_pages' shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 2.0.0. This is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on four user-supplied attributes (use_custom_link, use_custom_link_target, use_custom_thumbs, and use_custom_excerpt) in the 'show_child_pages' function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page."
