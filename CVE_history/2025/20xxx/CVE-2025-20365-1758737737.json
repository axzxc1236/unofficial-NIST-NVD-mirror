      "oldValue": "A vulnerability in the IPv6 Router Advertisement (RA) packet processing of Cisco Access Point Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to modify the IPv6 gateway on an affected device.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to a logic error in the processing of IPv6 RA packets that are received from wireless clients. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by associating to a wireless network and sending a series of crafted IPv6 RA packets. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to temporarily change the IPv6 gateway of an affected device. This could also lead to intermittent packet loss for any wireless clients that are associated with the affected device.",
