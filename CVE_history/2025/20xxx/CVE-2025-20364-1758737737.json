      "oldValue": "A vulnerability in the Device Analytics action frame processing of Cisco Wireless Access Point (AP) Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to inject wireless 802.11 action frames with arbitrary information.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to insufficient verification checks of incoming 802.11 action frames. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending 802.11 Device Analytics action frames with arbitrary parameters. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to inject Device Analytics action frames with arbitrary information, which could modify the Device Analytics data of valid wireless clients that are connected to the same wireless controller.",
