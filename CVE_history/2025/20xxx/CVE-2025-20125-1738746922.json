An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to a specific API on the device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to attacker to obtain information, modify system configuration, and reload the device.\r\nNote:&nbsp;To successfully exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have valid read-only administrative credentials.
