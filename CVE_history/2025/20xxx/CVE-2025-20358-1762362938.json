      "newValue": "A vulnerability in the Contact Center Express (CCX) Editor application of Cisco Unified CCX could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass authentication and obtain administrative permissions pertaining to script creation and execution.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to improper authentication mechanisms in the communication between the CCX Editor and an affected Unified CCX server. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by redirecting the authentication flow to a malicious server and tricking the CCX Editor into believing the authentication was successful. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to create and execute arbitrary scripts on the underlying operating system of an affected Unified CCX server, as an internal non-root user account."
