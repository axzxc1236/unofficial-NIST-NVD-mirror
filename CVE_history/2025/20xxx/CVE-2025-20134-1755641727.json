An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted SSL/TLS certificate to an affected system through a listening SSL/TLS socket. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.",

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted DNS packets that match a static Network Address Translation (NAT) rule with DNS inspection enabled through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition."
