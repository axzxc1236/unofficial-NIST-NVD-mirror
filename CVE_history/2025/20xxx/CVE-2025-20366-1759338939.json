      "newValue": "In Splunk Enterprise versions below 9.4.4, 9.3.6, and 9.2.8, and Splunk Cloud Platform versions below 9.3.2411.111, 9.3.2408.119, and 9.2.2406.122, a low-privileged user that does not hold the admin or power Splunk roles could access sensitive search results if Splunk Enterprise runs an administrative search job in the background. If the low privileged user guesses the search jobâ€™s unique Search ID (SID), the user could retrieve the results of that job, potentially exposing sensitive search results.
