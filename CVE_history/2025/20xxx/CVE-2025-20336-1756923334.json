An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted packet to the IP address of a device that has Web Access enabled. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access sensitive information from the device.\r\nNote: To exploit this vulnerability, Web Access must be enabled on the phone. Web Access is disabled by default."
