      "newValue": "In Splunk Enterprise versions below 10.0.1, 9.4.5, 9.3.7, and 9.2.9 and Splunk Cloud Platform versions below 9.3.2411.116, 9.3.2408.124, 10.0.2503.5 and 10.1.2507.1, a low-privileged user that does not hold the “admin“ or “power“ Splunk roles could run a saved search with a risky command using the permissions of a higher-privileged user to bypass the SPL safeguards for risky commands. They could bypass these safeguards on the “/services/streams/search“ endpoint through its “q“ parameter by circumventing endpoint restrictions using character encoding in the REST path. The vulnerability requires the attacker to phish the victim by tricking them into initiating a request within their browser. The authenticated user should not be able to exploit the vulnerability at will."
