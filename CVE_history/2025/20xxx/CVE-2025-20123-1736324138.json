      "newValue": "Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco Crosswork Network Controller could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks against users of the interface of an affected system.\r\n\r\nThese vulnerabilities exist because the web-based management interface does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by inserting malicious data into specific data fields in the interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information. To exploit these vulnerabilities, the attacker must have valid administrative credentials.\r\nCisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities."
