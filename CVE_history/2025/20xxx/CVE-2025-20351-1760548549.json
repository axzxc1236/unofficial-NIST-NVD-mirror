      "newValue": "A vulnerability in the web UI of Cisco Desk Phone 9800 Series, Cisco IP Phone 7800 and 8800 Series, and Cisco Video Phone 8875 running Cisco SIP Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct XSS attacks against a user of the web UI.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability exists because the web UI of an affected device does not sufficiently validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.\r\nNote: To exploit this vulnerability, the phone must be registered to Cisco Unified Communications Manager and have Web Access enabled. Web Access is disabled by default."
