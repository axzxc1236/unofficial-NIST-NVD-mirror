      "newValue": "The System Dashboard plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 2.8.20. This is due to missing nonce validation on the sd_toggle_logs() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to toggle critical logging settings including Page Access Logs, Error Logs, and Email Delivery Logs via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link."
