      "newValue": "The Felan Framework plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to improper authentication in versions up to, and including, 1.1.4. This is due to the hardcoded password in the 'fb_ajax_login_or_register' function and in the 'google_ajax_login_or_register' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as any existing user on the site, if they registered with facebook or google social login and did not change their password."
