      "newValue": "A path traversal validation flaw exists in Keycloakâ€™s vault key handling on Windows. The previous fix for CVE-2024-10492 did not account for the Windows file separator (\\). As a result, a high-privilege administrator could probe for the existence of files outside the expected realm context through crafted vault secret lookups. This is a platform-specific variant/incomplete fix of CVE-2024-10492."
