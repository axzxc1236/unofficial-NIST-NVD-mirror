      "newValue": "A flaw in the binding process of Govee’s cloud platform and devices allows a remote attacker to bind an existing, online Govee device to the attacker’s account, resulting in full control of the device and removal of the device from its legitimate owner’s account.\nThe server‑side API allows device association using a set of identifiers: \"device\", \"sku\", \"type\", and a client‑computed \"value\", that are not cryptographically bound to a secret originating from the device itself.\n\nThe vulnerability has been verified for the Govee H6056 - lamp device in firmware version 1.08.13, but may affect also other Govee cloud‑connected devices. The vendor is not able to provide a list of affected products, but rolls out a firmware and server-side fixes. Devices that reached end‑of‑life for security support need replacement with newer models supporting updates."
