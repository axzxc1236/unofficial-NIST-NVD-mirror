      "newValue": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nirqchip/gic-v2m: Prevent use after free of gicv2m_get_fwnode()\n\nWith ACPI in place, gicv2m_get_fwnode() is registered with the pci\nsubsystem as pci_msi_get_fwnode_cb(), which may get invoked at runtime\nduring a PCI host bridge probe. But, the call back is wrongly marked as\n__init, causing it to be freed, while being registered with the PCI\nsubsystem and could trigger:\n\n Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address ffff8000816c0400\n  gicv2m_get_fwnode+0x0/0x58 (P)\n  pci_set_bus_msi_domain+0x74/0x88\n  pci_register_host_bridge+0x194/0x548\n\nThis is easily reproducible on a Juno board with ACPI boot.\n\nRetain the function for later use."
