      "newValue": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: txgbe: fix memory leak in txgbe_probe() error path\n\nWhen txgbe_sw_init() is called, memory is allocated for wx->rss_key\nin wx_init_rss_key(). However, in txgbe_probe() function, the subsequent\nerror paths after txgbe_sw_init() don't free the rss_key. Fix that by\nfreeing it in error path along with wx->mac_table.\n\nAlso change the label to which execution jumps when txgbe_sw_init()\nfails, because otherwise, it could lead to a double free for rss_key,\nwhen the mac_table allocation fails in wx_sw_init()."
