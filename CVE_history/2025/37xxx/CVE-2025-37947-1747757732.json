      "newValue": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nksmbd: prevent out-of-bounds stream writes by validating *pos\n\nksmbd_vfs_stream_write() did not validate whether the write offset\n(*pos) was within the bounds of the existing stream data length (v_len).\nIf *pos was greater than or equal to v_len, this could lead to an\nout-of-bounds memory write.\n\nThis patch adds a check to ensure *pos is less than v_len before\nproceeding. If the condition fails, -EINVAL is returned."
