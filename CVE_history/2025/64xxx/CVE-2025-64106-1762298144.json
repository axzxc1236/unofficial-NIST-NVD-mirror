In versions 1.7.28 and below, an input validation flaw in Cursor's MCP server installation enables specially crafted deep-links to bypass the standard security warnings and conceal executed commands from users if they choose to accept the server. If an attacker is able to convince a victim to navigate to a malicious deeplink, the victim will not see the correct speedbump modal, and if they choose to accept, will execute commands specified by the attackers deeplink."
