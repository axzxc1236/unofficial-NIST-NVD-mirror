A vulnerability in versions prior to 11.13.0 allows authenticated users to search concealed/sensitive fields when they have read permissions. While actual values remain masked (`****`), successful matches can be detected through returned records, enabling enumeration attacks on sensitive data. Version 11.13.0 fixes the issue."
