      "newValue": "Cursor is a code editor built for programming with AI. In versions 1.7.44 and below, various NTFS path quirks allow a prompt injection attacker to circumvent sensitive file protections and overwrite files which Cursor requires human approval to overwrite. Modification of some of the protected files can lead to RCE. Must be chained with a prompt injection or malicious model attach. Only affects systems supporting NTFS. This issue is fixed in version 2.0."
