In versions 2.0.1 and prior, a heap-buffer-overflow vulnerability in the rastertopclx filter causes the program to crash with a segmentation fault when processing maliciously crafted input data. This issue can be exploited to trigger memory corruption, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution. This issue has been patched via commit 956283c."
