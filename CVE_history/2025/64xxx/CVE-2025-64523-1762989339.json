      "newValue": "File Browser provides a file managing interface within a specified directory and it can be used to upload, delete, preview, rename and edit files. Versions prior to 2.45.1 have an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability in the FileBrowser application's share deletion functionality. This vulnerability allows any authenticated user with share permissions to delete other users' shared links without authorization checks. The impact is significant as malicious actors can disrupt business operations by systematically removing shared files and links. This leads to denial of service for legitimate users, potential data loss in collaborative environments, and breach of data confidentiality agreements. In organizational settings, this could affect critical file sharing for projects, presentations, or document collaboration. Version 2.45.1 contains a fix for the issue."
