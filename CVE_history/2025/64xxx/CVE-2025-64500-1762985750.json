      "newValue": "Symfony is a PHP framework for web and console applications and a set of reusable PHP components. Symfony's HttpFoundation component defines an object-oriented layer for the HTTP specification. Starting in version 2.0.0 and prior to version 5.4.50, 6.4.29, and 7.3.7, the `Request` class improperly interprets some `PATH_INFO` in a way that leads to representing some URLs with a path that doesn't start with a `/`. This can allow bypassing some access control rules that are built with this `/`-prefix assumption. Starting in versions 5.4.50, 6.4.29, and 7.3.7, the `Request` class now ensures that URL paths always start with a `/`."
