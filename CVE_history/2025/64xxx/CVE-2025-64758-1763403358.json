      "newValue": "@dependencytrack/frontend is a Single Page Application (SPA) used in Dependency-Track, an open source Component Analysis platform that allows organizations to identify and reduce risk in the software supply chain. Since version 4.12.0, Dependency-Track users with the SYSTEM_CONFIGURATION permission can configure a \"welcome message\", which is HTML that is to be rendered on the login page for branding purposes. When rendering the welcome message, Dependency-Track versions before 4.13.6 did not properly sanitize the HTML, allowing arbitrary JavaScript to be executed. Users with the SYSTEM_CONFIGURATION permission (i.e., administrators), can exploit this weakness to execute arbitrary JavaScript for users browsing to the login page. The issue has been fixed in version 4.13.6."
