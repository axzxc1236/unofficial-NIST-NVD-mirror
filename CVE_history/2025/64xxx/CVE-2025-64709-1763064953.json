      "newValue": "Typebot is an open-source chatbot builder. In versions prior to 3.13.1, a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in the Typebot webhook block (HTTP Request component) functionality allows authenticated users to make arbitrary HTTP requests from the server, including access to AWS Instance Metadata Service (IMDS). By bypassing IMDSv2 protection through custom header injection, attackers can extract temporary AWS IAM credentials for the EKS node role, leading to complete compromise of the Kubernetes cluster and associated AWS infrastructure. Version 3.13.1 fixes the issue."
