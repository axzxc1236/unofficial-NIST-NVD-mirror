      "newValue": "matrix-rust-sdk is an implementation of a Matrix client-server library in Rust. matrix-sdk-crypto since version 0.8.0 and up to 0.11.0 does not correctly validate the sender of an encrypted event. Accordingly, a malicious homeserver operator can modify events served to clients, making those events appear to the recipient as if they were sent by another user. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.11.1 and 0.12.0."
