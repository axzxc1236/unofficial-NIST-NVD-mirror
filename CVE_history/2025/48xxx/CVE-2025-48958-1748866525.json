      "newValue": "Froxlor is open source server administration software. Prior to version 2.2.6, an HTML Injection vulnerability in the customer account portal allows an attacker to inject malicious HTML payloads in the email section. This can lead to phishing attacks, credential theft, and reputational damage by redirecting users to malicious external websites. The vulnerability has a medium severity, as it can be exploited through user input without authentication. Version 2.2.6 fixes the issue."
