      "newValue": "The DASHBOARD BUILDER – WordPress plugin for Charts and Graphs plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.5.7. This is due to missing nonce validation on the settings handler in dashboardbuilder-admin.php. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify the stored SQL query and database credentials used by the [show-dashboardbuilder] shortcode via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. The modified SQL query is subsequently executed on the front-end when the shortcode is rendered, enabling arbitrary SQL injection and data exfiltration through the publicly visible chart output."
