This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the download_plugin_bulk and download_theme_bulk functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to archive all the sites plugins and themes and place them in the `wp-content/uploads/` directory via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link."
