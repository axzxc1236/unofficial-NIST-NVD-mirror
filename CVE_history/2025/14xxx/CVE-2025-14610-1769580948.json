      "newValue": "The TableMaster for Elementor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.6. This is due to the plugin not restricting which URLs can be fetched when importing CSV data from a URL in the Data Table widget. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Author-level access and above, to make web requests to arbitrary locations, including localhost and internal network services, and read sensitive files such as wp-config.php via the 'csv_url' parameter."
