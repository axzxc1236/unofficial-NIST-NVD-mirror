Image Gallery, (HTML5 video , YouTube, Vimeo) Video Gallery and Lightbox for native gallery plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of plugin settings in all versions up to, and including, 3.3.0. This is due to the plugin using the `edit_posts` capability check instead of `manage_options` for the `update_option` action type in the `pgc_sgb_action_wizard` AJAX handler. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to modify arbitrary plugin settings prefixed with `pgc_sgb_*`."
