      "newValue": "The Frontend Admin by DynamiApps plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Privilege Escalation in all versions up to, and including, 3.28.25. This is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied role values in the 'validate_value', 'pre_update_value', and 'get_fields_display' functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to register as administrators and gain complete control of the site, granted they can access a user registration form containing a Role field."
