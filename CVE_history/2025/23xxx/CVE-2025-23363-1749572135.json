The SSO login service of affected applications accepts user-controlled input that could specify a link to an external site. This could allow an attacker to redirect the legitimate user to an attacker-chosen URL to steal valid session data. For a successful exploit, the legitimate user must actively click on an attacker-crafted link.",
