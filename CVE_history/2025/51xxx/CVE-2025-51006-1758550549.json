      "newValue": "Within tcpreplay's tcprewrite, a double free vulnerability has been identified in the dlt_linuxsll2_cleanup() function in plugins/dlt_linuxsll2/linuxsll2.c. This vulnerability is triggered when tcpedit_dlt_cleanup() indirectly invokes the cleanup routine multiple times on the same memory region. By supplying a specifically crafted pcap file to the tcprewrite binary, a local attacker can exploit this flaw to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) via memory corruption."
