      "newValue": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nLoongArch: BPF: Sign extend kfunc call arguments\n\nThe kfunc calls are native calls so they should follow LoongArch calling\nconventions. Sign extend its arguments properly to avoid kernel panic.\nThis is done by adding a new emit_abi_ext() helper. The emit_abi_ext()\nhelper performs extension in place meaning a value already store in the\ntarget register (Note: this is different from the existing sign_extend()\nhelper and thus we can't reuse it)."
