      "newValue": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmm/slub: reset KASAN tag in defer_free() before accessing freed memory\n\nWhen CONFIG_SLUB_TINY is enabled, kfree_nolock() calls kasan_slab_free()\nbefore defer_free(). On ARM64 with MTE (Memory Tagging Extension),\nkasan_slab_free() poisons the memory and changes the tag from the\noriginal (e.g., 0xf3) to a poison tag (0xfe).\n\nWhen defer_free() then tries to write to the freed object to build the\ndeferred free list via llist_add(), the pointer still has the old tag,\ncausing a tag mismatch and triggering a KASAN use-after-free report:\n\n  BUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in defer_free+0x3c/0xbc mm/slub.c:6537\n  Write at addr f3f000000854f020 by task kworker/u8:6/983\n  Pointer tag: [f3], memory tag: [fe]\n\nFix this by calling kasan_reset_tag() before accessing the freed memory.\nThis is safe because defer_free() is part of the allocator itself and is\nexpected to manipulate freed memory for bookkeeping purposes."
