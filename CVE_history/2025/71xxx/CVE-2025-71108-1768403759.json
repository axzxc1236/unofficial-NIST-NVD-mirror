      "newValue": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nusb: typec: ucsi: Handle incorrect num_connectors capability\n\nThe UCSI spec states that the num_connectors field is 7 bits, and the\n8th bit is reserved and should be set to zero.\nSome buggy FW has been known to set this bit, and it can lead to a\nsystem not booting.\nFlag that the FW is not behaving correctly, and auto-fix the value\nso that the system boots correctly.\n\nFound on Lenovo P1 G8 during Linux enablement program. The FW will\nbe fixed, but seemed worth addressing in case it hit platforms that\naren't officially Linux supported."
