      "newValue": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nvia_wdt: fix critical boot hang due to unnamed resource allocation\n\nThe VIA watchdog driver uses allocate_resource() to reserve a MMIO\nregion for the watchdog control register. However, the allocated\nresource was not given a name, which causes the kernel resource tree\nto contain an entry marked as \"<BAD>\" under /proc/iomem on x86\nplatforms.\n\nDuring boot, this unnamed resource can lead to a critical hang because\nsubsequent resource lookups and conflict checks fail to handle the\ninvalid entry properly."
