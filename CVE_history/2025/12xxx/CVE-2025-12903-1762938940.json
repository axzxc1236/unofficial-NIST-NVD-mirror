      "newValue": "The Payment Plugins Braintree For WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass due to a missing capability check on the wc-braintree/v1/3ds/vaulted_nonce REST API endpoint in all versions up to, and including, 3.2.78. This is due to the endpoint being registered with permission_callback set to __return_true and processing user-supplied token IDs without verifying ownership or authentication. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to retrieve payment method nonces for any stored payment token in the system, which can be used to create fraudulent transactions, charge customer credit cards, or attach payment methods to other subscriptions."
