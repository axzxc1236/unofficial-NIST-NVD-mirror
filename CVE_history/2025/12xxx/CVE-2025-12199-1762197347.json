The manipulation results in null pointer dereference. The attack needs to be approached locally. The exploit has been made public and could be used. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.",
      "newValue": "A vulnerability was found in dnsmasq up to 2.73rc6. Affected by this vulnerability is the function check_servers of the file src/network.c of the component Config File Handler. The manipulation results in null pointer dereference. The attack needs to be approached locally. The exploit has been made public and could be used. It is still unclear if this vulnerability genuinely exists. This attack requires manipulating config files which might not be a realistic scenario in many cases. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way."
