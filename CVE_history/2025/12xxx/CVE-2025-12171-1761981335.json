      "type": "Description",
      "newValue": "The RESTful Content Syndication plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the ingest_image() function in versions 1.1.0 to 1.5.0. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Author-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible. This requires the attacker have access to a defined third-party server as specified in the settings, so it is unlikely that this will be exploitable by contributor-level users, and more likely to be exploited by administrators who also have access to the plugin's settings."
