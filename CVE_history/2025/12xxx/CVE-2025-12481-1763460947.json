      "newValue": "The WP Duplicate Page plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Missing Authorization in all versions up to, and including, 1.7. This is due to the plugin not properly verifying that a user is authorized to perform an action in the 'saveSettings' function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to modify plugin settings that control role capabilities, and subsequently exploit the misconfigured capabilities to duplicate and view password-protected posts containing sensitive information."
