      "newValue": "The Document Embedder – Embed PDFs, Word, Excel, and Other Files plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access/modification/loss of data in all versions up to, and including, 2.0.0. This is due to the plugin not properly verifying that a user is authorized to perform an action in the \"bplde_save_document_library\", \"bplde_get_all\", \"bplde_get_single\", and \"bplde_delete_document_library\" functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to create, read, update, and delete arbitrary document_library posts."
