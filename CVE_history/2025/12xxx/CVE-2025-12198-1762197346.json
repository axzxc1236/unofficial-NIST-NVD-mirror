The manipulation of the argument i leads to heap-based buffer overflow. Local access is required to approach this attack. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The real existence of this vulnerability is still doubted at the moment. This attack requires manipulating config files which might not be a realistic scenario in many cases. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way."
