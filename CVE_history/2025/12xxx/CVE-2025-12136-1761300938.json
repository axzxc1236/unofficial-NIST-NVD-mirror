      "newValue": "The Real Cookie Banner: GDPR & ePrivacy Cookie Consent plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 5.2.4. This is due to insufficient validation on the user-supplied URL in the '/scanner/scan-without-login' REST API endpoint. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level access and above, to make web requests to arbitrary locations originating from the web application and can be used to query and modify information from internal services via the `url` parameter."
