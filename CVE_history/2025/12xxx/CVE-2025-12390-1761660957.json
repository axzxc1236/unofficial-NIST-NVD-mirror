      "newValue": "A flaw was found in Keycloak. In Keycloak where a user can accidentally get access to another user's session if both use the same device and browser. This happens because Keycloak sometimes reuses session identifiers and doesnâ€™t clean up properly during logout when browser cookies are missing. As a result, one user may receive tokens that belong to another user."
