      "newValue": "The YITH WooCommerce Wishlist plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass in all versions up to, and including, 4.10.0. This is due to the plugin not properly verifying that a user is authorized to perform actions on the REST API /wp-json/yith/wishlist/v1/lists endpoint (which uses permission_callback => '__return_true') and the AJAX delete_item handler (which only checks nonce validity without verifying object-level authorization). This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to disclose wishlist tokens for any user and subsequently delete wishlist items by chaining the REST API authorization bypass with the exposed delete_item nonce on shared wishlist pages and the AJAX handler's missing object-level authorization check."
