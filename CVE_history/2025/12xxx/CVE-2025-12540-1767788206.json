      "newValue": "The ShareThis Dashboard for Google Analytics plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Sensitive Information Exposure in all versions up to, and including, 3.2.4. This is due to the Google Analytics client_ID and client_secret being stored in plaintext in the publicly visible plugin source. This can allow unauthenticated attackers to craft a link to the sharethis.com server, which will share an authorization token for Google Analytics with a malicious website, if the attacker can trick an administrator logged into the website and Google Analytics to click the link."
