In versions 1.8.185 and below, the application performs deserialization of data that can allow authenticated attackers with knowledge of the application's APP_KEY to achieve remote code execution. The vulnerability can be exploited via endpoint: `/help/{mailbox_id}/auth/{customer_id}/{hash}/{timestamp}` where the `customer_id` and `timestamp` parameters are processed through the decrypt function in `app/Helper.php` without proper validation. The vulnerable code performs decryption using Laravel's built-in encryption functions, which subsequently deserializes the decrypted payload without sanitization. This is fixed in version 1.8.186.",

Versions 1.8.185 and earlier contain a deserialization of untrusted data vulnerability that allows authenticated attackers with knowledge of the application's APP_KEY to achieve remote code execution.

The code decrypts using Laravel's built-in encryption functions, which subsequently deserialize the decrypted payload without sanitization, allowing attackers to craft malicious serialized PHP objects using classes to trigger arbitrary command execution.
