      "newValue": "DeepChat is a smart assistant uses artificial intelligence. Prior to version 0.3.5, in the Mermaid chart rendering component, there is a risky operation of directly using `innerHTML` to set user content. Therefore, any malicious content rendered via Mermaid will directly trigger the exploit chain, leading to command execution. This vulnerability is primarily caused by a failure to fully address the existing XSS issue in the project, leading to another exploit chain. The exploit chain is consistent with the report GHSA-hqr4-4gfc-5p2j, executing arbitrary JavaScript code via XSS and arbitrary commands via exposed IPC. Version 0.3.5 contains an updated fix."
