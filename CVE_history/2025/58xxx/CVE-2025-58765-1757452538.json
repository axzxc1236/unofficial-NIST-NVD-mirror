      "newValue": "wabac.js provides a full web archive replay system, or 'wayback machine', using Service Workers. A Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the 404 error handling logic of wabac.js v2.23.10 and below. The parameter `requestURL` (derived from the original request target) is directly embedded into an inline `<script>` block without sanitization or escaping. This allows an attacker to craft a malicious URL that executes arbitrary JavaScript in the victimâ€™s browser. The scope may be limited by CORS policies, depending on the situation in which wabac.js is used. The vulnerability is fixed in wabac.js v2.23.11."
