      "newValue": "The Volkov Labs Business Links panel for Grafana provides an interface to navigate using external links, internal dashboards, time pickers, and dropdown menus. Prior to version 2.4.0, a malicious actor with Editor privileges can escalate their privileges to Administrator and perform arbitrary administrative actions. This is possible because the plugin allows arbitrary JavaScript code injection in the [Layout] → [Link] → [URL] field. Version 2.4.0 contains a fix for the issue."
