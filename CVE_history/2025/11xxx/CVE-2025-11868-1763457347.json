      "newValue": "The everviz plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the `everviz` shortcode attributes in versions up to, and including, 1.1. This is due to the plugin not properly sanitizing user input or escaping output when building a `<div id=...>` from the `type` and `hash` attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page."
