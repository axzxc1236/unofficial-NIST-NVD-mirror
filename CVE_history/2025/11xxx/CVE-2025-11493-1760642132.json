      "newValue": "The ConnectWise Automate Agent does not fully verify the authenticity of files downloaded from the server, such as updates, dependencies, and integrations. This creates a risk where an on-path attacker could perform a man-in-the-middle attack and substitute malicious files for legitimate ones by impersonating a legitimate server. This risk is mitigated when HTTPS is enforced and is related to CVE-2025-11492."
