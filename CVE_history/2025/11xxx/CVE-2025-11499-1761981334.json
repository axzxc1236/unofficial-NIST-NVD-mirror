      "newValue": "The Tablesome Table – Contact Form DB – WPForms, CF7, Gravity, Forminator, Fluent plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the set_featured_image_from_external_url() function in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.32. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible in configurations where unauthenticated users have been provided with a method for adding featured images, and the workflow trigger is created."
