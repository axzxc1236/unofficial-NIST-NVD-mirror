This is due to the fact that the /render/csv endpoint lacked validation of the filePath parameter that allowed an attacker to save a shared object to an arbitrary location that is then loaded by the Chromium process.\n\nInstances are vulnerable if:\n\n1. The default token (\"authToken\") is not changed, or is known to the attacker.\n2. The attacker can reach the image renderer endpoint.\nThis issue affects grafana-image-renderer: from 1.0.0 through 4.0.16."
