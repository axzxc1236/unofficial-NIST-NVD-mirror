      "newValue": "The Binary MLM Plan plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to insecure direct object reference in versions up to, and including, 3.0. This is due to the bmp_user_payout_detail_of_current_user() function selecting payout records solely by id without verifying ownership. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with the bmp_user role (often subscribers) to view other members' payout summaries via direct requests to the /bmp-account-detail/ endpoint with a crafted payout-id parameter granted they can access the shortcode output."
