      "newValue": "The Crypto plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Information exposure in all versions up to, and including, 2.22. This is due to the plugin registering an unauthenticated AJAX action (wp_ajax_nopriv_crypto_connect_ajax_process) that allows calling the register and savenft methods with only a publicly-available nonce check and no wallet signature verification. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to set a site-wide global authentication state via a single transient, bypassing all access controls for ALL visitors to the site. The impact is complete bypass of [crypto-block] shortcode restrictions and page-level access controls, affecting all site visitors for one hour, plus the ability to inject arbitrary data into the plugin's custom_users table."
