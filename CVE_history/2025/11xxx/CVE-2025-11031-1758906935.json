      "newValue": "A flaw has been found in DataTables up to 1.10.13. The affected element is an unknown function of the file /examples/resources/examples.php. This manipulation of the argument src causes path traversal. It is possible to initiate the attack remotely. The exploit has been published and may be used. Upgrading to version 1.10.15 is sufficient to fix this issue. Patch name: 3b24f99ac4ddb7f9072076b0d07f0b1a408f177a. Upgrading the affected component is advised. This vulnerability was initially reported for code-projects Faculty Management System but appears to affect DataTables as an upstream component instead. The vendor of DataTables explains: \"I would suggest that the author upgrade to the latest versions of DataTables (actually, they shouldn't really be deploying that file to their own server at all - it is only relevant for the DataTables examples).\""
