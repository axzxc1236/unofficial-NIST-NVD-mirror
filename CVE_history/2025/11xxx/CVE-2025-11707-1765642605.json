      "newValue": "The Login Lockdown & Protection plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to IP Block Bypass in all versions up to, and including, 2.14. This is due to $unblock_key key being insufficiently random allowing unauthenticated users, with access to an administrative user email, to generate valid unblock keys for their IP Address. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to bypass blocks due to invalid login attempts."
