      "newValue": "The AI Chatbot Free Models â€“ Customer Support, Live Chat, Virtual Assistant plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to CSV Injection in all versions up to, and including, 1.6.5. This is due to insufficient sanitization in the 'newcodebyte_chatbot_export_messages' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to embed untrusted input into exported CSV files, which can result in code execution when these files are downloaded and opened on a local system with a vulnerable configuration."
