      "newValue": "The Affiliate AI Lite plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the 'asin' shortcode attribute in the affiai_img shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.1. This is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page."
