      "newValue": "The Crypto plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized manipulation of data in all versions up to, and including, 2.22. This is due to the plugin registering an unauthenticated AJAX action (wp_ajax_nopriv_crypto_connect_ajax_process) that allows calling the crypto_delete_json method with only a publicly-available nonce check. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete specific JSON files matching the pattern *_pending.json within the wp-content/uploads/yak/ directory, causing data loss and denial of service for plugin workflows that rely on these artifacts."
