      "newValue": "The Beaver Builder – WordPress Page Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Missing Authorization in all versions up to, and including, 2.9.4. This is due to insufficient capability checks in the REST API endpoints under the 'fl-controls/v1' namespace that control site-wide Global Presets. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with contributor-level access and above to add, modify, or delete global color and background presets that affect all Beaver Builder content site-wide."
