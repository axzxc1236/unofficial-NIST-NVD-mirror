      "newValue": "The AI Engine plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Sensitive Information Exposure in all versions up to, and including, 3.1.3 via the /mcp/v1/ REST API endpoint that exposes the 'Bearer Token' value when 'No-Auth URL' is enabled. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to extract the bearer token, which can be used to gain access to a valid session and perform many actions like creating a new administrator account, leading to privilege escalation."
