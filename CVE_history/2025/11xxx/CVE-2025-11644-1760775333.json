      "oldValue": "A weakness has been identified in Tomofun Furbo 360 and Furbo Mini. Affected by this issue is some unknown functionality of the component UART Interface. Executing manipulation can lead to insecure storage of sensitive information. The physical device can be targeted for the attack. This attack is characterized by high complexity. The exploitation is known to be difficult. The exploit has been made available to the public and could be exploited. The firmware versions determined to be affected are Furbo 360 up to FB0035_FW_036 and Furbo Mini up to MC0020_FW_074. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.",
