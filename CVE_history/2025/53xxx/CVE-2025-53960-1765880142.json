    {
      "action": "Changed",
      "type": "Description",
      "oldValue": "When encrypting sensitive data, weak encryption keys that are fixed or directly generated based on user passwords are used. Attackers can obtain these keys through methods such as reverse engineering, code leaks, or password guessing, thereby decrypting stored or transmitted encrypted data, leading to the leakage of sensitive information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis issue affects Apache StreamPark: from 2.0.0 before 2.1.7.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 2.1.7, which fixes the issue.",
      "newValue": "When issuing JSON Web Tokens (JWT), Apache StreamPark directly uses the user's password as the HMAC signing key (e.g., with the HS256 algorithm). An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to perform offline brute-force attacks on the user's password using a captured JWT, or to arbitrarily forge identity tokens for the user if the password is already known, ultimately leading to complete account takeover.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis issue affects Apache StreamPark: from 2.0.0 before 2.1.7.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 2.1.7, which fixes the issue."
