OpenBao before v2.3.0 may leak sensitive information in logs when processing malformed data. This is separate from the earlier HCSEC-2025-09 / CVE-2025-4166. This issue has been fixed in OpenBao v2.3.0 and later. Like with HCSEC-2025-09, there is no known workaround except to ensure properly formatted requests from all clients."
