      "newValue": "Allure 2 is the version 2.x branch of Allure Report, a multi-language test reporting tool. A critical XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerability exists in the xunit-xml-plugin used by Allure 2 prior to version 2.34.1. The plugin fails to securely configure the XML parser (`DocumentBuilderFactory`) and allows external entity expansion when processing test result .xml files. This allows attackers to read arbitrary files from the file system and potentially trigger server-side request forgery (SSRF). Version 2.34.1 contains a patch for the issue."
