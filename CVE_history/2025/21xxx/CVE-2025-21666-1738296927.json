      "newValue": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nvsock: prevent null-ptr-deref in vsock_*[has_data|has_space]\n\nRecent reports have shown how we sometimes call vsock_*_has_data()\nwhen a vsock socket has been de-assigned from a transport (see attached\nlinks), but we shouldn't.\n\nPrevious commits should have solved the real problems, but we may have\nmore in the future, so to avoid null-ptr-deref, we can return 0\n(no space, no data available) but with a warning.\n\nThis way the code should continue to run in a nearly consistent state\nand have a warning that allows us to debug future problems."
