      "newValue": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nwifi: cfg80211: cancel wiphy_work before freeing wiphy\n\nA wiphy_work can be queued from the moment the wiphy is allocated and\ninitialized (i.e. wiphy_new_nm). When a wiphy_work is queued, the\nrdev::wiphy_work is getting queued.\n\nIf wiphy_free is called before the rdev::wiphy_work had a chance to run,\nthe wiphy memory will be freed, and then when it eventally gets to run\nit'll use invalid memory.\n\nFix this by canceling the work before freeing the wiphy."
