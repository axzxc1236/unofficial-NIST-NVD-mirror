      "newValue": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nublk: make sure ubq->canceling is set when queue is frozen\n\nNow ublk driver depends on `ubq->canceling` for deciding if the request\ncan be dispatched via uring_cmd & io_uring_cmd_complete_in_task().\n\nOnce ubq->canceling is set, the uring_cmd can be done via ublk_cancel_cmd()\nand io_uring_cmd_done().\n\nSo set ubq->canceling when queue is frozen, this way makes sure that the\nflag can be observed from ublk_queue_rq() reliably, and avoids\nuse-after-free on uring_cmd."
