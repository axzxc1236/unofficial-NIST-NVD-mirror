      "newValue": "Under heavy system utilization a random race condition can occur during authentication or token refresh operation. This flaw allows one user to be granted a token intended for another user, resulting in impersonation until the session is ended. This flaw cannot be intentionally exploited due to the required concurring action by two users. However, if the event occurs a user would be inadvertently exposed to another userâ€™s system rights and data access."
