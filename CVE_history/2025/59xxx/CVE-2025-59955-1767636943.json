Coolify versions prior to and including v4.0.0-beta.420.8 have an information disclosure vulnerability in the `/api/v1/teams/{team_id}/members` and `/api/v1/teams/current/members` API endpoints allows authenticated team members to access a highly sensitive `email_change_code` from other users on the same team.
