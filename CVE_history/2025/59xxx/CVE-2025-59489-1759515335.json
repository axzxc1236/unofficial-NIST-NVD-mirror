      "oldValue": "Unity Editor 2019.1 through 6000.3 could allow remote attackers to exploit file loading and Local File Inclusion (LFI) mechanisms via a crafted local application because of an Untrusted Search Path. This could permit unauthorized manipulation of runtime resources and third-party integrations. The issue could affect applications built using Unity and deployed across Android, Windows, macOS, and Linux platforms.",
      "newValue": "Unity Runtime before 2025-10-02 on Android, Windows, macOS, and Linux allows argument injection that can result in loading of library code from an unintended location. If an application was built with a version of Unity Editor that had the vulnerable Unity Runtime code, then an adversary may be able to execute code on, and exfiltrate confidential information from, the machine on which that application is running. NOTE: product status is provided for Unity Editor because that is the information available from the Supplier. However, updating Unity Editor typically does not address the effects of the vulnerability; instead, it is necessary to rebuild and redeploy all affected applications."
