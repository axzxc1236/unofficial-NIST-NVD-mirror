      "newValue": "CubeCart is an ecommerce software solution. Prior to version 6.5.11, the contact formâ€™s Enquiry field accepts raw HTML and that HTML is included verbatim in the email sent to the store admin. By submitting HTML in the Enquiry, the admin receives an email containing that HTML. This indicates user input is not being escaped or sanitized before being output in email (and possibly when re-rendering the form), leading to Cross-Site Scripting / HTML injection risk in email clients or admin UI. This issue has been patched in version 6.5.11."
