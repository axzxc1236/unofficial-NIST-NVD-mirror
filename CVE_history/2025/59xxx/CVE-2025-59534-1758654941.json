Prior to version 1.4.2, there is a command Injection vulnerability in initialize_kerberos_keytab_file_login(). The vulnerability exists because the code directly interpolates user-controlled input into a shell command and executes it via system() without any sanitization or validation. This issue has been patched in version 1.4.2."
