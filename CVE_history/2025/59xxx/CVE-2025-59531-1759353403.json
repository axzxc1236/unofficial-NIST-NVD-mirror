      "newValue": "Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. Versions 1.2.0 through 1.8.7, 2.0.0-rc1 through 2.14.19, 3.0.0-rc1 through 3.2.0-rc1, 3.1.7 and 3.0.18 are vulnerable to malicious API requests which can crash the API server and cause denial of service to legitimate clients. Without a configured webhook.bitbucketserver.secret, Argo CD's /api/webhook endpoint crashes when receiving a malformed Bitbucket Server payload (non-array repository.links.clone field). A single unauthenticated request triggers CrashLoopBackOff, and targeting all replicas causes complete API outage. This issue is fixed in versions 2.14.20, 3.2.0-rc2, 3.1.8 and 3.0.19."
