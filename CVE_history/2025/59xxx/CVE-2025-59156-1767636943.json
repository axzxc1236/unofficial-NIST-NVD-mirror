      "newValue": "Coolify is an open-source and self-hostable tool for managing servers, applications, and databases. Prior to version 4.0.0-beta.420.7, a Remote Code Execution (RCE)*vulnerability exists in Coolify's application deployment workflow. This flaw allows a low-privileged member to inject arbitrary Docker Compose directives during project creation or updates. By defining a malicious service that mounts the host filesystem, an attacker can achieve root-level command execution on the host OS, completely bypassing container isolation. Version 4.0.0-beta.420.7 contains a patch for the issue."
