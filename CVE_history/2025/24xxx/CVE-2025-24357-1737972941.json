      "newValue": "vLLM is a library for LLM inference and serving. vllm/model_executor/weight_utils.py implements hf_model_weights_iterator to load the model checkpoint, which is downloaded from huggingface. It uses the torch.load function and the weights_only parameter defaults to False. When torch.load loads malicious pickle data, it will execute arbitrary code during unpickling. This vulnerability is fixed in v0.7.0."
