      "oldValue": "Hotta Studio GameDriverX64.sys 7.23.4.7, a signed kernel-mode anti-cheat driver, allows local attackers to cause a denial of service by crashing arbitrary processes via sending crafted IOCTL requests.",
      "newValue": "The GameDriverX64.sys kernel-mode anti-cheat driver (v7.23.4.7 and earlier) contains an access control vulnerability in one of its IOCTL handlers. A user-mode process can open a handle to the driver device and send specially crafted IOCTL requests. These requests are executed in kernel-mode context without proper authentication or access validation, allowing the attacker to terminate arbitrary processes, including critical system and security services, without requiring administrative privileges."
