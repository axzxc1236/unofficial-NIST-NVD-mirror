      "type": "Description",
      "newValue": "A vulnerability has been identified in the GRUB (Grand Unified Bootloader) component. This flaw occurs because the bootloader mishandles string conversion when reading information from a USB device, allowing an attacker to exploit inconsistent length values. A local attacker can connect a maliciously configured USB device during the boot sequence to trigger this issue. A successful exploitation may lead GRUB to crash, leading to a Denial of Service. Data corruption may be also possible, although given the complexity of the exploit the impact is most likely limited."
