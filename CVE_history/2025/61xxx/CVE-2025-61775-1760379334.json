      "newValue": "Vickey is a Misskey-based microblogging platform. A vulnerability exists in Vickey prior to version 2025.10.0 where unexpired email confirmation links can be reused multiple times to send repeated confirmation emails to a verified email address. Under certain conditions, a verified email address could receive repeated confirmation messages if the verification link was accessed multiple times. This issue may result in unintended email traffic but does not expose user data. The issue was addressed in version 2025.10.0 by improving validation logic to ensure verification links behave as expected after completion."
