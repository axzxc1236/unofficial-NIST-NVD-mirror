      "oldValue": "Mozilla Firefox's update mechanism allowed a medium-integrity user process to interfere with the SYSTEM-level updater by manipulating the file-locking behavior. By injecting code into the user-privileged process, an attacker could bypass intended access controls, allowing SYSTEM-level file operations on paths controlled by a non-privileged user and enabling privilege escalation. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 138, Firefox ESR < 128.10, Firefox ESR < 115.23, Thunderbird < 138, and Thunderbird ESR < 128.10.",
