      "newValue": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nALSA: usb-audio: Fix NULL pointer dereference in snd_usb_mixer_controls_badd\n\nIn snd_usb_create_streams(), for UAC version 3 devices, the Interface\nAssociation Descriptor (IAD) is retrieved via usb_ifnum_to_if(). If this\ncall fails, a fallback routine attempts to obtain the IAD from the next\ninterface and sets a BADD profile. However, snd_usb_mixer_controls_badd()\nassumes that the IAD retrieved from usb_ifnum_to_if() is always valid,\nwithout performing a NULL check. This can lead to a NULL pointer\ndereference when usb_ifnum_to_if() fails to find the interface descriptor.\n\nThis patch adds a NULL pointer check after calling usb_ifnum_to_if() in\nsnd_usb_mixer_controls_badd() to prevent the dereference.\n\nThis issue was discovered by syzkaller, which triggered the bug by sending\na crafted USB device descriptor."
