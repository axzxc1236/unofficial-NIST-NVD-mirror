      "newValue": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbpf: Reject negative offsets for ALU ops\n\nWhen verifying BPF programs, the check_alu_op() function validates\ninstructions with ALU operations. The 'offset' field in these\ninstructions is a signed 16-bit integer.\n\nThe existing check 'insn->off > 1' was intended to ensure the offset is\neither 0, or 1 for BPF_MOD/BPF_DIV. However, because 'insn->off' is\nsigned, this check incorrectly accepts all negative values (e.g., -1).\n\nThis commit tightens the validation by changing the condition to\n'(insn->off != 0 && insn->off != 1)'. This ensures that any value\nother than the explicitly permitted 0 and 1 is rejected, hardening the\nverifier against malformed BPF programs."
