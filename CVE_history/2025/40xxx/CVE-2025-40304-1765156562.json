      "newValue": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nfbdev: Add bounds checking in bit_putcs to fix vmalloc-out-of-bounds\n\nAdd bounds checking to prevent writes past framebuffer boundaries when\nrendering text near screen edges. Return early if the Y position is off-screen\nand clip image height to screen boundary. Break from the rendering loop if the\nX position is off-screen. When clipping image width to fit the screen, update\nthe character count to match the clipped width to prevent buffer size\nmismatches.\n\nWithout the character count update, bit_putcs_aligned and bit_putcs_unaligned\nreceive mismatched parameters where the buffer is allocated for the clipped\nwidth but cnt reflects the original larger count, causing out-of-bounds writes."
