      "newValue": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnvmet-fc: move lsop put work to nvmet_fc_ls_req_op\n\nIt’s possible for more than one async command to be in flight from\n__nvmet_fc_send_ls_req. For each command, a tgtport reference is taken.\n\nIn the current code, only one put work item is queued at a time, which\nresults in a leaked reference.\n\nTo fix this, move the work item to the nvmet_fc_ls_req_op struct, which\nalready tracks all resources related to the command."
