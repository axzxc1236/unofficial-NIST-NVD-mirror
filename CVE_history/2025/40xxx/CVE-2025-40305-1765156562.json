      "newValue": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\n9p/trans_fd: p9_fd_request: kick rx thread if EPOLLIN\n\np9_read_work() doesn't set Rworksched and doesn't do schedule_work(m->rq)\nif list_empty(&m->req_list).\n\nHowever, if the pipe is full, we need to read more data and this used to\nwork prior to commit aaec5a95d59615 (\"pipe_read: don't wake up the writer\nif the pipe is still full\").\n\np9_read_work() does p9_fd_read() -> ... -> anon_pipe_read() which (before\nthe commit above) triggered the unnecessary wakeup. This wakeup calls\np9_pollwake() which kicks p9_poll_workfn() -> p9_poll_mux(), p9_poll_mux()\nwill notice EPOLLIN and schedule_work(&m->rq).\n\nThis no longer happens after the optimization above, change p9_fd_request()\nto use p9_poll_mux() instead of only checking for EPOLLOUT."
