      "newValue": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nslab: Avoid race on slab->obj_exts in alloc_slab_obj_exts\n\nIf two competing threads enter alloc_slab_obj_exts() and one of them\nfails to allocate the object extension vector, it might override the\nvalid slab->obj_exts allocated by the other thread with\nOBJEXTS_ALLOC_FAIL. This will cause the thread that lost this race and\nexpects a valid pointer to dereference a NULL pointer later on.\n\nUpdate slab->obj_exts atomically using cmpxchg() to avoid\nslab->obj_exts overrides by racing threads.\n\nThanks for Vlastimil and Suren's help with debugging."
