      "newValue": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: sched: act_ife: initialize struct tc_ife to fix KMSAN kernel-infoleak\n\nFix a KMSAN kernel-infoleak detected  by the syzbot .\n\n[net?] KMSAN: kernel-infoleak in __skb_datagram_iter\n\nIn tcf_ife_dump(), the variable 'opt' was partially initialized using a\ndesignatied initializer. While the padding bytes are reamined\nuninitialized. nla_put() copies the entire structure into a\nnetlink message, these uninitialized bytes leaked to userspace.\n\nInitialize the structure with memset before assigning its fields\nto ensure all members and padding are cleared prior to beign copied.\n\nThis change silences the KMSAN report and prevents potential information\nleaks from the kernel memory.\n\nThis fix has been tested and validated by syzbot. This patch closes the\nbug reported at the following syzkaller link and ensures no infoleak."
