      "newValue": "libsnowflakeclient is the Snowflake Connector for C/C++. Versions starting from 0.5.0 to before 2.2.0, are vulnerable to local logging of sensitive information. When the logging level was set to DEBUG, the Connector would log locally the client-side encryption master key of the target stage during the execution of GET/PUT commands. This key by itself does not grant access to any sensitive data without additional access authorizations, and is not logged server-side by Snowflake. This issue has been patched in version 2.2.0."
