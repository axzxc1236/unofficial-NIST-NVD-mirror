      "newValue": "YoutubeDLSharp is a wrapper for the command-line video downloaders youtube-dl and yt-dlp. In versions starting from 1.0.0-beta4 and prior to 1.1.2, an unsafe conversion of arguments allows the injection of a malicious commands when starting `yt-dlp` from a commands prompt running on Windows OS with the `UseWindowsEncodingWorkaround` value defined to true (default behavior). If a user is using built-in methods from the YoutubeDL.cs file, the value is true by default and a user cannot disable it from these methods. This issue has been patched in version 1.1.2."
