      "newValue": "A Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability was discovered in the /publix/run endpoint of JATOS 3.7.1 through 3.9.6 (inclusive). This allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript in a user's web browser by including a malicious payload in the \"code\" URL parameter. When an authenticated admin user accesses the study's URL, the malicious script gets interpreted and executes within their browser, which can lead to unauthorized actions, account compromise, and privilege escalation."
