      "type": "Description",
      "newValue": "The SourceCodester Android application \"Corona Virus Tracker App India\" 1.0 uses MD5 for digest authentication in `OkHttpClientWrapper.java`. The `handleDigest()` function employs `MessageDigest.getInstance(\"MD5\")` to hash credentials. MD5 is a broken cryptographic algorithm known to allow hash collisions. This makes the authentication mechanism vulnerable to replay, spoofing, or brute-force attacks, potentially leading to unauthorized access. The vulnerability corresponds to CWE-327 and aligns with OWASP M5: Insufficient Cryptography and MASVS MSTG-CRYPTO-4."
