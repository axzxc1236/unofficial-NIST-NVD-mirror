      "newValue": "LinkedIn Mobile Application for Android version 4.1.1087.2 fails to update link preview metadata (image, title, description) when a user replaces the original URL in a post or comment before publishing. As a result, the stale preview remains visible while the clickable link points to a different URL, which can be malicious. This UI misrepresentation enables attackers to deceive users by displaying trusted previews for harmful links, facilitating phishing attacks and user confusion."
