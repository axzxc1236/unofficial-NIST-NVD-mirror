FD602GW-DX-R410 (firmware v2.2.14), the web management interface contains an authenticated CSRF vulnerability on the reboot endpoint (/boaform/admin/formReboot). An attacker can craft a malicious webpage that, when visited by an authenticated administrator, causes the router to reboot without explicit user consent. This lack of CSRF protection on a sensitive administrative function can lead to denial of service by disrupting network availability."
