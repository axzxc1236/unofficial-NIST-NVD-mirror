      "newValue": "Datart 1.0.0-rc.3 is vulnerable to Directory Traversal. The configuration file handling of the application allows attackers to upload arbitrary YAML files to the config/jdbc-driver-ext.yml path. The application parses this file using SnakeYAML's unsafe load() or loadAs() method without input sanitization. This allows deserialization of attacker-controlled YAML content, leading to arbitrary class instantiation. Under certain conditions, this can be exploited to achieve remote code execution (RCE)."
