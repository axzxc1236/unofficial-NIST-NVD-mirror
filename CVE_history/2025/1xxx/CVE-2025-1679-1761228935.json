This vulnerability is classified as stored cross-site scripting (XSS); attackers inject malicious scripts into the system, and the scripts persist across sessions. There is no impact to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the affected device; no loss of availability within any subsequent systems but has some loss of confidentiality and integrity within the subsequent system."
