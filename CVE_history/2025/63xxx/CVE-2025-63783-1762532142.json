      "newValue": "A Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA) vulnerability was discovered in the tRPC project mutation APIs (update, delete, add/remove tag) of the Onlook web application 0.2.32. The vulnerability exists because the API fails to verify the ownership or membership of the currently authenticated user for the requested project ID. An authenticated attacker can send a malicious request containing another user's project ID to unlawfully modify, delete, or manipulate tags on that project, which can severely compromise data integrity and availability."
