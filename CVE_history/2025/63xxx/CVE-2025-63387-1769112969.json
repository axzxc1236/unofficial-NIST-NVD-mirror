An unauthenticated attacker can directly send HTTP GET requests to the /console/api/system-features endpoint without any authentication credentials or session tokens. The endpoint fails to implement proper authorization checks, allowing anonymous access to sensitive system configuration data.",
      "newValue": "Dify v1.9.1 is vulnerable to Insecure Permissions. An unauthenticated attacker can directly send HTTP GET requests to the /console/api/system-features endpoint without any authentication credentials or session tokens. The endpoint fails to implement proper authorization checks, allowing anonymous access to sensitive system configuration data. NOTE: The maintainer states that the endpoint is unauthenticated by design and serves as a bootstrap mechanism required for the dashboard initialization. They also state that the description inaccurately classifies the returned data as sensitive system configuration, stating that the data is non-sensitive and required for client-side rendering. No PII, credentials, or secrets are exposed."
