      "newValue": "The Itel DAB Encoder (IDEnc build 25aec8d) is vulnerable to Authentication Bypass due to improper JWT validation across devices. Attackers can reuse a valid JWT token obtained from one device to authenticate and gain administrative access to any other device running the same firmware, even if the passwords and networks are different. This allows full compromise of affected devices."
