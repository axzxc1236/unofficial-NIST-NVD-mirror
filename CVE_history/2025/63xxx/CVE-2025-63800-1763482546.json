      "type": "Description",
      "newValue": "The password change endpoint in Open Source Point of Sale 3.4.1 allows users to set their account password to an empty string due to missing server-side validation. When an authenticated user omits or leaves the `password` and `repeat_password` parameters empty in the password change request, the backend still returns a successful response and sets the password to an empty string. This effectively disables authentication and may allow unauthorized access to user or administrative accounts."
