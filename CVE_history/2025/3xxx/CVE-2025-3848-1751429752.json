      "newValue": "The Download Manager and Payment Form WordPress Plugin â€“ WP SmartPay plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation via account takeover in versions 1.1.0 to 2.7.13. This is due to the plugin not properly validating a user's identity prior to updating their email through the update() function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to change arbitrary user's email addresses, including administrators, and leverage that to reset the user's password and gain access to their account."
