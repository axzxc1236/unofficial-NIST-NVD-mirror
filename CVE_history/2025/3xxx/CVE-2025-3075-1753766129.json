      "newValue": "The Elementor Website Builder â€“ More Than Just a Page Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's 'elementor-element' shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 3.29.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only impacts sites with 'Element Caching' enabled."
