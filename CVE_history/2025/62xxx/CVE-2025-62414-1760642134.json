      "newValue": "Bagisto is an open source laravel eCommerce platform. In Bagisto v2.3.7, the “Create New Customer” feature (in the admin panel) is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). An attacker with access to the admin create-customer form can inject malicious JavaScript payloads into certain input fields. These payloads may later execute in the context of an admin’s browser or another user viewing the customer data, enabling session theft or admin-level actions. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.3.8."
