An authenticated attacker could encrypt a single large file without triggering a detection alert if thresholds are configured to require multiple file changes. The number of files to cause a detection alert can be configured by the user. Versions 4.6.0.0, 4.6.0.6, 4.6.0.7, and 4.6.1.4 were confirmed to be affected; other versions before and after may also be affected.",
