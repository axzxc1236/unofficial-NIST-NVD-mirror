Prior to version 3.10.0, an unauthenticated attacker could access this page to view the Service Now public instance name e.g. companyname.service-now.com. This is considered low-value information. This does not expose the Secret, the Secret Name, or the Secret Value for the Username/Password for Service-Now.com. An unauthenticated member would not be able to change the instance name, nor set a Secret. There is not a way to gain access to other pages Nautobot through the unauthenticated Configuration page. This issue has been patched in version 3.10.0."
