      "type": "Description",
      "oldValue": "BullWall Ransomware Containment contains excluded file paths, such as '$recycle.bin' that are not monitored. An attacker with file write permissions could bypass detection by renaming a directory. Versions 4.6.0.0, 4.6.0.6, 4.6.0.7, and 4.6.1.4 were confirmed to be affected; other versions before and after may also be affected.",
      "newValue": "BullWall Ransomware Containment supports configurable file and directory exclusions such as '$recycle.bin' to balance monitoring scope and performance. Certain exclusion patterns could allow an authenticated attacker with file-write permissions to rename directories in a way that avoids monitoring. Fixed in 4.6.1.14 and 5.0.0.42, which removes hardcoded exclusion behavior and exposes exclusion handling as configurable settings."
