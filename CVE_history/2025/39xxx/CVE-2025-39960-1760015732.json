This breaks the i2c_hid_cpi driver:\n\n[   58.122916] i2c_hid_acpi i2c-UNIW0001:00: HID over i2c has not been provided an Int IRQ\n[   58.123097] i2c_hid_acpi i2c-UNIW0001:00: probe with driver i2c_hid_acpi failed with error -22\n\nFix this by initializing the acpi_gpio_info pass to __acpi_find_gpio()"
