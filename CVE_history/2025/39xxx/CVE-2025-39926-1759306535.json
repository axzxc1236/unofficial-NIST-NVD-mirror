      "newValue": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ngenetlink: fix genl_bind() invoking bind() after -EPERM\n\nPer family bind/unbind callbacks were introduced to allow families\nto track multicast group consumer presence, e.g. to start or stop\nproducing events depending on listeners.\n\nHowever, in genl_bind() the bind() callback was invoked even if\ncapability checks failed and ret was set to -EPERM. This means that\ncallbacks could run on behalf of unauthorized callers while the\nsyscall still returned failure to user space.\n\nFix this by only invoking bind() after \"if (ret) break;\" check\ni.e. after permission checks have succeeded."
