      "newValue": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\naudit: fix out-of-bounds read in audit_compare_dname_path()\n\nWhen a watch on dir=/ is combined with an fsnotify event for a\nsingle-character name directly under / (e.g., creating /a), an\nout-of-bounds read can occur in audit_compare_dname_path().\n\nThe helper parent_len() returns 1 for \"/\". In audit_compare_dname_path(),\nwhen parentlen equals the full path length (1), the code sets p = path + 1\nand pathlen = 1 - 1 = 0. The subsequent loop then dereferences\np[pathlen - 1] (i.e., p[-1]), causing an out-of-bounds read.\n\nFix this by adding a pathlen > 0 check to the while loop condition\nto prevent the out-of-bounds access.\n\n[PM: subject tweak, sign-off email fixes]"
