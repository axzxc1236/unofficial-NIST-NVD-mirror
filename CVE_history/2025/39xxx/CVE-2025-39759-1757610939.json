      "newValue": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbtrfs: qgroup: fix race between quota disable and quota rescan ioctl\n\nThere's a race between a task disabling quotas and another running the\nrescan ioctl that can result in a use-after-free of qgroup records from\nthe fs_info->qgroup_tree rbtree.\n\nThis happens as follows:\n\n1) Task A enters btrfs_ioctl_quota_rescan() -> btrfs_qgroup_rescan();\n\n2) Task B enters btrfs_quota_disable() and calls\n   btrfs_qgroup_wait_for_completion(), which does nothing because at that\n   point fs_info->qgroup_rescan_running is false (it wasn't set yet by\n   task A);\n\n3) Task B calls btrfs_free_qgroup_config() which starts freeing qgroups\n   from fs_info->qgroup_tree without taking the lock fs_info->qgroup_lock;\n\n4) Task A enters qgroup_rescan_zero_tracking() which starts iterating\n   the fs_info->qgroup_tree tree while holding fs_info->qgroup_lock,\n   but task B is freeing qgroup records from that tree without holding\n   the lock, resulting in a use-after-free.\n\nFix this by taking fs_info->qgroup_lock at btrfs_free_qgroup_config().\nAlso at btrfs_qgroup_rescan() don't start the rescan worker if quotas\nwere already disabled."
