Users with the \"Manage roles and permissions\" privilege can promote themselves or other DOC users to the Supervisor role through an API call. This privilege is included by default in the Administrator role. This issue mainly affects cloud multi-tenant deployments; on-prem single-tenant installations are typically not impacted because local admins usually already have Supervisor privileges."
