      "newValue": "The Auth0 Next.js SDK is a library for implementing user authentication in Next.js applications. Versions 4.9.0 through 4.12.1 contain an input-validation flaw in the returnTo parameter, which could allow attackers to inject unintended OAuth query parameters into the Auth0 authorization request.
