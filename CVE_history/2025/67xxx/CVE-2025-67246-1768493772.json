      "newValue": "A local information disclosure vulnerability exists in the Ludashi driver before 5.1025 due to a lack of access control in the IOCTL handler. This driver exposes a device interface accessible to a normal user and handles attacker-controlled structures containing the lower 4GB of physical addresses. The handler maps arbitrary physical memory via MmMapIoSpace and copies data back to user mode without verifying the caller's privileges or the target address range. This allows unprivileged users to read arbitrary physical memory, potentially exposing kernel data structures, kernel pointers, security tokens, and other sensitive information. This vulnerability can be further exploited to bypass the Kernel Address Space Layout Rules (KASLR) and achieve local privilege escalation."
