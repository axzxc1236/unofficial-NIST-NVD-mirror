      "newValue": "ChurchCRM is an open-source church management system. Prior to version 6.5.0, a SQL injection vulnerability exists in the `EventEditor.php` file. When creating a new event and selecting an event type, the `EN_tyid` POST parameter is not sanitized. This allows an authenticated user with event management permissions (`isAddEvent`) to execute arbitrary SQL queries. Version 6.5.0 fixes the issue."
