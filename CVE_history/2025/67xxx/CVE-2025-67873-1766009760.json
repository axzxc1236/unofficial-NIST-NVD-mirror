      "newValue": "Capstone is a disassembly framework. In versions 6.0.0-Alpha5 and prior, Skipdata length is not bounds-checked, so a user-provided skipdata callback can make cs_disasm/cs_disasm_iter memcpy more than 24 bytes into cs_insn.bytes, causing a heap buffer overflow in the disassembly path. Commit cbef767ab33b82166d263895f24084b75b316df3 fixes the issue."
