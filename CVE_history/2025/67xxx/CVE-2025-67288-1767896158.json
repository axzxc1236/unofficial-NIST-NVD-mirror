NOTE: this is disputed by the Supplier because the responsibility for file validation (as shown in the documentation) belongs to the system administrator who is implementing Umbraco CMS in their environment, not to Umbraco CMS itself. The supplier also believes that this CVE is a duplicate of CVE-2023-49279 because the CVEs only differ in the file type.",
