      "newValue": "The Home Villas | Real Estate WordPress Theme theme for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due to insufficient file path validation in the 'wp_rem_cs_widget_file_delete' function in all versions up to, and including, 2.8. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php)."
