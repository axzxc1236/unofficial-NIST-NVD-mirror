      "newValue": "The Hive Support plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access and modification of data due to a missing capability check on the hs_update_ai_chat_settings() and hive_lite_support_get_all_binbox() functions in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.4. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to read and overwrite the siteâ€™s OpenAI API key and inspection data or modify AI-chat prompts and behavior. This vulnerability is potentially a duplicate of CVE-2025-32208 or/and CVE-2025-32242."
