      "newValue": "SSRF and Reflected XSS Vulnerabilities exist in multiple WSO2 products within the deprecated Try-It feature, which was accessible only to administrative users. This feature accepted user-supplied URLs without proper validation, leading to server-side request forgery (SSRF). Additionally, the retrieved content was directly reflected in the HTTP response, enabling reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) in the admin user's browser context.\n\nBy tricking an administrator into accessing a crafted link, an attacker could force the server to fetch malicious content and reflect it into the adminâ€™s browser, leading to arbitrary JavaScript execution for UI manipulation or data exfiltration. While session cookies are protected with the HttpOnly flag, the XSS still poses a significant security risk.\n\nFurthermore, SSRF can be used by a privileged user to query internal services, potentially aiding in internal network enumeration if the target endpoints are reachable from the affected product."
