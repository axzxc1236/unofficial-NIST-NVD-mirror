      "newValue": "The Drag and Drop Multiple File Upload (Pro) - WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the dnd_upload_cf7_upload_chunks() function in version 5.0 - 5.0.5 (when bundled with the PrintSpace theme) and all versions up to, and including, 1.7.1 (in the standalone version). This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible. The execution of PHP is disabled via a .htaccess file but is still possible in certain server configurations."
