      "newValue": "phpPgAdmin 7.13.0 and earlier contains an incorrect access control vulnerability in sql.php at lines 68-76. The application allows unauthorized manipulation of session variables by accepting user-controlled parameters ('subject', 'server', 'database', 'queryid') without proper validation or access control checks. Attackers can exploit this to store arbitrary SQL queries in $_SESSION['sqlquery'] by manipulating these parameters, potentially leading to session poisoning, stored cross-site scripting, or unauthorized access to sensitive session data."
