      "newValue": "A vulnerability has been identified in Genexis Platinum P4410 router (Firmware P4410-V2–1.41) that allows a local network attacker to achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) with root privileges. The issue occurs due to improper session invalidation after administrator logout. When an administrator logs out, the session token remains valid. An attacker on the local network can reuse this stale token to send crafted requests via the router’s diagnostic endpoint, resulting in command execution as root."
