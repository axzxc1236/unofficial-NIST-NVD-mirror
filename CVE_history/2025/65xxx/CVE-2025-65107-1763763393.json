In versions from 2.95.0 to before 2.95.12 and from 3.17.0 to before 3.131.0, in SSO provider configurations without an explicit AUTH_<PROVIDER>_CHECK setting, a potential account takeover may happen if an authenticated user is made to call a specifically crafted URL via a CSRF or phishing attack. This issue has been patched in versions 2.95.12 and 3.131.0. A workaround for this issue involves setting AUTH_<PROVIDER>_CHECK."
