      "newValue": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nhisi_acc_vfio_pci: fix XQE dma address error\n\nThe dma addresses of EQE and AEQE are wrong after migration and\nresults in guest kernel-mode encryption services  failure.\nComparing the definition of hardware registers, we found that\nthere was an error when the data read from the register was\ncombined into an address. Therefore, the address combination\nsequence needs to be corrected.\n\nEven after fixing the above problem, we still have an issue\nwhere the Guest from an old kernel can get migrated to\nnew kernel and may result in wrong data.\n\nIn order to ensure that the address is correct after migration,\nif an old magic number is detected, the dma address needs to be\nupdated."
