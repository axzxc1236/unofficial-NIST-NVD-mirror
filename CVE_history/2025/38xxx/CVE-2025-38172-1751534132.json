      "newValue": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nerofs: avoid using multiple devices with different type\n\nFor multiple devices, both primary and extra devices should be the\nsame type. `erofs_init_device` has already guaranteed that if the\nprimary is a file-backed device, extra devices should also be\nregular files.\n\nHowever, if the primary is a block device while the extra device\nis a file-backed device, `erofs_init_device` will get an ENOTBLK,\nwhich is not treated as an error in `erofs_fc_get_tree`, and that\nleads to an UAF:\n\n  erofs_fc_get_tree\n    get_tree_bdev_flags(erofs_fc_fill_super)\n      erofs_read_superblock\n        erofs_init_device  // sbi->dif0 is not inited yet,\n                           // return -ENOTBLK\n      deactivate_locked_super\n        free(sbi)\n    if (err is -ENOTBLK)\n      sbi->dif0.file = filp_open()  // sbi UAF\n\nSo if -ENOTBLK is hitted in `erofs_init_device`, it means the\nprimary device must be a block device, and the extra device\nis not a block device. The error can be converted to -EINVAL."
