      "newValue": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/msm/a7xx: Call CP_RESET_CONTEXT_STATE\n\nCalling this packet is necessary when we switch contexts because there\nare various pieces of state used by userspace to synchronize between BR\nand BV that are persistent across submits and we need to make sure that\nthey are in a \"safe\" state when switching contexts. Otherwise a\nuserspace submission in one context could cause another context to\nfunction incorrectly and hang, effectively a denial of service (although\nwithout leaking data). This was missed during initial a7xx bringup.\n\nPatchwork: https://patchwork.freedesktop.org/patch/654924/"
