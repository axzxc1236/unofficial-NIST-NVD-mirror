They are just harder to\ntrigger.\n\nThe solution is similar. Use a separate flag to track the condition\n'socket state prevent any additional subflow creation' protected by the\nfallback lock.\n\nThe socket fallback makes such flag true, and also receiving or sending\nan MP_FAIL option.\n\nThe field 'allow_infinite_fallback' is now always touched under the\nrelevant lock, we can drop the ONCE annotation on write."
