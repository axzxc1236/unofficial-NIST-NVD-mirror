With certain high GPU loads it is possible to\nreach the critical hardware shutdown temperature of 120°C, endangering the\nhardware and making it impossible to run certain applications.\n\nSet up GPU cooling similar to the ACPI tables, by throttling the GPU speed\nwhen reaching 95°C and polling every 200ms."
