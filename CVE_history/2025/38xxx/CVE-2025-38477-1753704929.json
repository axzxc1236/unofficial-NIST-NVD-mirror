      "newValue": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet/sched: sch_qfq: Fix race condition on qfq_aggregate\n\nA race condition can occur when 'agg' is modified in qfq_change_agg\n(called during qfq_enqueue) while other threads access it\nconcurrently. For example, qfq_dump_class may trigger a NULL\ndereference, and qfq_delete_class may cause a use-after-free.\n\nThis patch addresses the issue by:\n\n1. Moved qfq_destroy_class into the critical section.\n\n2. Added sch_tree_lock protection to qfq_dump_class and\nqfq_dump_class_stats."
