      "newValue": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbpf, arm64: Fix fp initialization for exception boundary\n\nIn the ARM64 BPF JIT when prog->aux->exception_boundary is set for a BPF\nprogram, find_used_callee_regs() is not called because for a program\nacting as exception boundary, all callee saved registers are saved.\nfind_used_callee_regs() sets `ctx->fp_used = true;` when it sees FP\nbeing used in any of the instructions.\n\nFor programs acting as exception boundary, ctx->fp_used remains false\neven if frame pointer is used by the program and therefore, FP is not\nset-up for such programs in the prologue. This can cause the kernel to\ncrash due to a pagefault.\n\nFix it by setting ctx->fp_used = true for exception boundary programs as\nfp is always saved in such programs."
