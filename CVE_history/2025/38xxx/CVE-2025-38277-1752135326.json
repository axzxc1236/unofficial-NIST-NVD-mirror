      "newValue": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmtd: nand: ecc-mxic: Fix use of uninitialized variable ret\n\nIf ctx->steps is zero, the loop processing ECC steps is skipped,\nand the variable ret remains uninitialized. It is later checked\nand returned, which leads to undefined behavior and may cause\nunpredictable results in user space or kernel crashes.\n\nThis scenario can be triggered in edge cases such as misconfigured\ngeometry, ECC engine misuse, or if ctx->steps is not validated\nafter initialization.\n\nInitialize ret to zero before the loop to ensure correct and safe\nbehavior regardless of the ctx->steps value.\n\nFound by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE."
