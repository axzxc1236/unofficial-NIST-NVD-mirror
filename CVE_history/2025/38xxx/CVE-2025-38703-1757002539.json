      "newValue": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/xe: Make dma-fences compliant with the safe access rules\n\nXe can free some of the data pointed to by the dma-fences it exports. Most\nnotably the timeline name can get freed if userspace closes the associated\nsubmit queue. At the same time the fence could have been exported to a\nthird party (for example a sync_fence fd) which will then cause an use-\nafter-free on subsequent access.\n\nTo make this safe we need to make the driver compliant with the newly\ndocumented dma-fence rules. Driver has to ensure a RCU grace period\nbetween signalling a fence and freeing any data pointed to by said fence.\n\nFor the timeline name we simply make the queue be freed via kfree_rcu and\nfor the shared lock associated with multiple queues we add a RCU grace\nperiod before freeing the per GT structure holding the lock."
