      "newValue": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nvsock: Do not allow binding to VMADDR_PORT_ANY\n\nIt is possible for a vsock to autobind to VMADDR_PORT_ANY. This can\ncause a use-after-free when a connection is made to the bound socket.\nThe socket returned by accept() also has port VMADDR_PORT_ANY but is not\non the list of unbound sockets. Binding it will result in an extra\nrefcount decrement similar to the one fixed in fcdd2242c023 (vsock: Keep\nthe binding until socket destruction).\n\nModify the check in __vsock_bind_connectible() to also prevent binding\nto VMADDR_PORT_ANY."
