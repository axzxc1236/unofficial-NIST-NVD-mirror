      "newValue": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbus: mhi: ep: Update read pointer only after buffer is written\n\nInside mhi_ep_ring_add_element, the read pointer (rd_offset) is updated\nbefore the buffer is written, potentially causing race conditions where\nthe host sees an updated read pointer before the buffer is actually\nwritten. Updating rd_offset prematurely can lead to the host accessing\nan uninitialized or incomplete element, resulting in data corruption.\n\nInvoke the buffer write before updating rd_offset to ensure the element\nis fully written before signaling its availability."
