      "oldValue": "Multiple out-of-bounds read and write vulnerabilities exist in the ControlVault WBDI Driver Broadcom Storage Adapter functionality of Dell ControlVault3 prior to 5.15.14.19 and Dell ControlVault3 Plus prior to 6.2.36.47. A specially crafted WinBioControlUnit call can lead to memory corruption. An attacker can issue an api call to trigger this vulnerability. This vulnerability is triggered when submitting a `WinBioControlUnit` call to the StorageAdapter with the ControlCode 0 (`WBIO_USH_GET_TEMPLATE`) and with either `0 < ReceiveBuferSize < 4`  and/or `0 < SendBufferSize < 76`. The former will lead to an out-of-bound write of up to 3 bytes and the latter will trigger an out-of-bound read of up to 75 bytes.",
