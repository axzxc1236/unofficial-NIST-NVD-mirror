A specially crafted WinBioControlUnit call can lead to memory corruption. An attacker can issue an api call to trigger this vulnerability. This vulnerability is triggered when submitting a `WinBioControlUnit` call to the StorageAdapter with the ControlCode 3 (`WBIO_USH_CREATE_CHALLENGE`) and with  `0 < ReceiveBuferSize < 4`. Up to three null-bytes will be written past the end of the `ReceiveBuffer`.",
