      "newValue": "The Houzez theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via SVG File uploads in all versions up to, and including, 4.1.6 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping in the houzez_property_img_upload() and houzez_property_attachment_upload() functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses the SVG file."
