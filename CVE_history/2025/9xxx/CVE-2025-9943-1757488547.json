An unauthenticated attacker can exploit this issue via blind SQL injection, allowing for the extraction of arbitrary data from the database, if the database connection is configured to use the ODBC plugin.Â The vulnerability arises from insufficient escaping of single quotes in the class SQLString (file odbc-store.cpp, lines 253-271).\n\nThis issue affects Shibboleth Service Provider through 3.5.0."
