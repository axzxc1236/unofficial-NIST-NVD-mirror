      "newValue": "The TextBuilder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions 1.0.0 to 1.1.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the 'handleToken' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update a user's authorization token via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. Once the token is updated, an attacker can update the user's password and email address."
