      "newValue": "The Coil Web Monetization plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 2.0.2. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the coil-get-css-selector parameter handling in the maybe_restrict_content function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to trigger CSS selector detection functionality via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link."
