      "type": "Description",
      "newValue": "The communication protocol implemented in Ghost Robotics Vision 60 v0.27.2 could allow an attacker to send commands to the robot from an external attack station, impersonating the control station (tablet) and gaining unauthorised full control of the robot. The absence of encryption and authentication mechanisms in the communication protocol allows an attacker to capture legitimate traffic between the robot and the controller, replicate it, and send any valid command to the robot from any attacking computer or device. The communication protocol used in this interface is based on MAVLink, a widely documented protocol, which increases the likelihood of attack. There are two methods for connecting to the robot remotely: Wi-Fi and 4G/LTE."
