      "newValue": "An XSS vulnerability in pxc_portCntr2.php can be used by an unauthenticated remote attacker to trick an authenticated user to send a manipulated POST request to the device in order to change parameters available via web based management (WBM). The vulnerability does not provide access to system-level resources such as operating system internals or privileged functions. Access is limited to device configuration parameters that are available in the context of the web application. The session cookie is secured by the httpOnly Flag. Therefore an attacker is not able to take over the session of an authenticated user."
