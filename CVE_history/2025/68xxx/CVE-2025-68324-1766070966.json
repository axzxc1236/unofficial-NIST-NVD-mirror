      "newValue": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nscsi: imm: Fix use-after-free bug caused by unfinished delayed work\n\nThe delayed work item 'imm_tq' is initialized in imm_attach() and\nscheduled via imm_queuecommand() for processing SCSI commands.  When the\nIMM parallel port SCSI host adapter is detached through imm_detach(),\nthe imm_struct device instance is deallocated.\n\nHowever, the delayed work might still be pending or executing\nwhen imm_detach() is called, leading to use-after-free bugs\nwhen the work function imm_interrupt() accesses the already\nfreed imm_struct memory.\n\nThe race condition can occur as follows:\n\nCPU 0(detach thread)   | CPU 1\n                       | imm_queuecommand()\n                       |   imm_queuecommand_lck()\nimm_detach()           |     schedule_delayed_work()\n  kfree(dev) //FREE    | imm_interrupt()\n                       |   dev = container_of(...) //USE\n                           dev-> //USE\n\nAdd disable_delayed_work_sync() in imm_detach() to guarantee proper\ncancellation of the delayed work item before imm_struct is deallocated."
