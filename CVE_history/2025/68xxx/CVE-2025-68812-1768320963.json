If inst->state is\nalready IRIS_INST_ERROR, we should skip the stream_off operation\nbecause it would still send packets to the firmware.\n\nIn iris_kill_session, inst->state is set to IRIS_INST_ERROR and\nsession_close is executed, which will kfree(inst_hfi_gen2->packet).\nIf stop_streaming is called afterward, it will cause a crash.\n\n[bod: remove qcom from patch title]"
