      "newValue": "ChurchCRM is an open-source church management system. A SQL Injection vulnerability exists in the legacy endpoint `/Reports/ConfirmReportEmail.php` in ChurchCRM prior to version 6.5.3. Although the feature was removed from the UI, the file remains deployed and reachable directly via URL. This is a classic case of *dead but reachable code*. Any authenticated user - including one with zero assigned permissions - can exploit SQL injection through the `familyId` parameter. Version 6.5.3 fixes the issue."
