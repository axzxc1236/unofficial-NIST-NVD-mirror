The length of the data after the header depends on the\ngs_host_frame hf::flags and the active device features (e.g. time\nstamping).\n\nIntroduce a new function gs_usb_get_minimum_length() and check that we have\nat least received the required amount of data before accessing it. Only\ncopy the data to that skb that has actually been received.\n\n[mkl: rename gs_usb_get_minimum_length() -> +gs_usb_get_minimum_rx_length()]"
