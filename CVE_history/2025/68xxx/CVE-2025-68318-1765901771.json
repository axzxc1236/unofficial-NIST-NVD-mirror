      "newValue": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nclk: thead: th1520-ap: set all AXI clocks to CLK_IS_CRITICAL\n\nThe AXI crossbar of TH1520 has no proper timeout handling, which means\ngating AXI clocks can easily lead to bus timeout and thus system hang.\n\nSet all AXI clock gates to CLK_IS_CRITICAL. All these clock gates are\nungated by default on system reset.\n\nIn addition, convert all current CLK_IGNORE_UNUSED usage to\nCLK_IS_CRITICAL to prevent unwanted clock gating."
