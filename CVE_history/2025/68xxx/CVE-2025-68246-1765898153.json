      "newValue": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nksmbd: close accepted socket when per-IP limit rejects connection\n\nWhen the per-IP connection limit is exceeded in ksmbd_kthread_fn(),\nthe code sets ret = -EAGAIN and continues the accept loop without\nclosing the just-accepted socket. That leaks one socket per rejected\nattempt from a single IP and enables a trivial remote DoS.\n\nRelease client_sk before continuing.\n\nThis bug was found with ZeroPath."
