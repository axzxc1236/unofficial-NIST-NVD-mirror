      "newValue": "Espressif ESP-IDF USB Host UVC Class Driver allows video streaming from USB cameras. Prior to 2.4.0, a vulnerability in the esp-usb UVC host implementation allows a malicious USB Video Class (UVC) device to trigger a stack buffer overflow during configuration-descriptor parsing. When UVC configuration-descriptor printing is enabled, the host prints detailed descriptor information provided by the connected USB device. A specially crafted UVC descriptor may advertise an excessively large length. Because this value is not validated before being copied into a fixed-size stack buffer, an attacker can overflow the buffer and corrupt memory. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.4.0."
