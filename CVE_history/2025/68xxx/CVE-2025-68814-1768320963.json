      "newValue": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nio_uring: fix filename leak in __io_openat_prep()\n\n __io_openat_prep() allocates a struct filename using getname(). However,\nfor the condition of the file being installed in the fixed file table as\nwell as having O_CLOEXEC flag set, the function returns early. At that\npoint, the request doesn't have REQ_F_NEED_CLEANUP flag set. Due to this,\nthe memory for the newly allocated struct filename is not cleaned up,\ncausing a memory leak.\n\nFix this by setting the REQ_F_NEED_CLEANUP for the request just after the\nsuccessful getname() call, so that when the request is torn down, the\nfilename will be cleaned up, along with other resources needing cleanup."
