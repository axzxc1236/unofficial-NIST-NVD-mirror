      "newValue": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\njfs: fix uninitialized waitqueue in transaction manager\n\nThe transaction manager initialization in txInit() was not properly\ninitializing TxBlock[0].waitor waitqueue, causing a crash when\ntxEnd(0) is called on read-only filesystems.\n\nWhen a filesystem is mounted read-only, txBegin() returns tid=0 to\nindicate no transaction. However, txEnd(0) still gets called and\ntries to access TxBlock[0].waitor via tid_to_tblock(0), but this\nwaitqueue was never initialized because the initialization loop\nstarted at index 1 instead of 0.\n\nThis causes a 'non-static key' lockdep warning and system crash:\n  INFO: trying to register non-static key in txEnd\n\nFix by ensuring all transaction blocks including TxBlock[0] have\ntheir waitqueues properly initialized during txInit()."
