We do not bring the buffer uptodate before setting it as\nuptodate. If the buffer were to not be uptodate, it could mean adding a\nbuffer with un-init data to the mi record. Attempting to load that record\nwill trigger KMSAN.\n\nAvoid this by setting the buffer as uptodate, if it’s not already, by\noverwriting it."
