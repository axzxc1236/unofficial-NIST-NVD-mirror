      "newValue": "@vitejs/plugin-rs provides React Server Components (RSC) support for Vite. Prior to version 0.5.8, the `/__vite_rsc_findSourceMapURL` endpoint in `@vitejs/plugin-rsc` allows unauthenticated arbitrary file read during development mode. An attacker can read any file accessible to the Node.js process by sending a crafted HTTP request with a `file://` URL in the `filename` query parameter. Version 0.5.8 fixes the issue."
