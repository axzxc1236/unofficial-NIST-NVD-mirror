      "newValue": "CKAN is an open-source DMS (data management system) for powering data hubs and data portals. Prior to 2.10.9 and 2.11.4, the helpers.markdown_extract() function did not perform sufficient sanitization of input data before wrapping in an HTML literal element. This helper is used to render user-provided data on dataset, resource, organization or group pages (plus any page provided by an extension that used that helper function), leading to a potential XSS vector. This vulnerability has been fixed in CKAN 2.10.9 and 2.11.4."
