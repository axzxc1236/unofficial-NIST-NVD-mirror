      "newValue": "An issue was discovered in Dolby UDC 4.5 through 4.13. A crash of the DD+ decoder process can occur when a malformed DD+ bitstream is processed. When Evolution data is processed by evo_priv.c from the DD+ bitstream, the decoder writes that data into a buffer. The length calculation for a write can overflow due to an integer wraparound. This can lead to the allocated buffer being too small, and the out-of-bounds check of the subsequent write to be ineffective, leading to an out-of-bounds write."
