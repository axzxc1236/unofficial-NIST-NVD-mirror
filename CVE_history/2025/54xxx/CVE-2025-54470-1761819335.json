      "newValue": "This vulnerability affects NeuVector deployments only when the Report anonymous cluster data option is enabled. When this option is enabled, NeuVector sends anonymous telemetry data to the telemetry server.\n\n\nIn affected versions, NeuVector does not enforce TLS \ncertificate verification when transmitting anonymous cluster data to the\n telemetry server. As a result, the communication channel is susceptible\n to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, where an attacker could intercept \nor modify the transmitted data. Additionally, NeuVector loads the \nresponse of the telemetry server is loaded into memory without size \nlimitation, which makes  it vulnerable to a Denial of Service(DoS) \nattack"
