      "newValue": "A vulnerability was identified in NeuVector, where the enforcer used environment variables CLUSTER_RPC_PORT and CLUSTER_LAN_PORT to generate a command to be executed via popen, without first sanitising their values.\n\n\nThe entry process of the enforcer container is the monitor\n process. When the enforcer container stops, the monitor process checks \nwhether the consul subprocess has exited. To perform this check, the \nmonitor process uses the popen function to execute a shell command that determines whether the ports used by the consul subprocess are still active.\n\n\nThe values of environment variables CLUSTER_RPC_PORT and CLUSTER_LAN_PORT\n are used directly to compose shell commands via popen without \nvalidation or sanitization.  This behavior could allow a malicious user \nto inject malicious commands through these variables within the enforcer\n container."
