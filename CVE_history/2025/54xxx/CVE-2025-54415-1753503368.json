      "newValue": "dag-factory is a library for Apache AirflowÂ® to construct DAGs declaratively via configuration files. In versions 0.23.0a8 and below, a high-severity vulnerability has been identified in the cicd.yml workflow within the astronomer/dag-factory GitHub repository. The workflow, specifically when triggered by pull_request_target, is susceptible to exploitation, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the GitHub Actions runner environment. This misconfiguration enables an attacker to establish a reverse shell, exfiltrate sensitive secrets, including the highly-privileged GITHUB_TOKEN, and ultimately gain full control over the repository. This is fixed in version 0.23.0a9."
