      "newValue": "XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. XWiki Platform Legacy Old Core and XWiki Platform Old Core versions 1.1 through 16.4.6, 16.5.0-rc-1 through 16.10.4 and 17.0.0-rc-1 through 17.1.0, the XML export of a page in XWiki that can be triggered by any user with view rights on a page by appending ?xpage=xml to the URL includes password and email properties stored on a document that aren't named password or email. This is fixed in versions 16.4.7, 16.10.5 and 17.2.0-rc-1. To work around this issue, the file templates/xml.vm in the deployed WAR can be deleted if the XML isn't needed. There isn't any feature in XWiki itself that depends on the XML export."
