      "newValue": "Radiometrics VizAir is vulnerable to exposure of the system's REST API key through a publicly accessible configuration file. This allows attackers to remotely alter weather data and configurations, automate attacks against multiple instances, and extract sensitive meteorological data, which could potentially compromise airport operations. Additionally, attackers could flood the system with false alerts, leading to a denial-of-service condition and significant disruption to airport operations. Unauthorized remote control over aviation weather monitoring and data manipulation could result in incorrect flight planning and hazardous takeoff and landing conditions."
