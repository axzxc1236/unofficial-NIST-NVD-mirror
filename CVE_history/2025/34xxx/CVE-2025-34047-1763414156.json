      "oldValue": "A path traversal vulnerability exists in the Leadsec SSL VPN (formerly Lenovo NetGuard), allowing unauthenticated attackers to read arbitrary files on the underlying system via the ostype parameter in the /vpn/user/download/client endpoint. This flaw arises from insufficient input sanitation, enabling traversal sequences to escape the intended directory and access sensitive files.",
