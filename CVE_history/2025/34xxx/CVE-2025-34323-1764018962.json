      "type": "Description",
      "oldValue": "Nagios Log Server versions prior to 2026R1.0.1 are vulnerable to local privilege escalation due to unsafe interaction between sudo rules and file system permissions. The web server account is granted passwordless sudo access to certain maintenance scripts while also being a member of a group that has write access to the directory containing those scripts. A local attacker running as the web server user can replace one of the permitted scripts with a malicious program and then execute it via sudo, resulting in arbitrary code execution with root privileges.",
      "newValue": "Nagios Log Server versions prior to 2026R1.0.1 are vulnerable to local privilege escalation due to a combination of sudo misconfiguration and group-writable application directories. The 'www-data' user is a member of the 'nagios' group, which has write access to '/usr/local/nagioslogserver/scripts', while several scripts in this directory are owned by root and may be executed via sudo without a password. A local attacker running as 'www-data' can move one of these root-owned scripts to a backup name and create a replacement script with attacker-controlled content at the original path, then invoke it with sudo. This allows arbitrary commands to be executed with root privileges, providing full compromise of the underlying operating system."
