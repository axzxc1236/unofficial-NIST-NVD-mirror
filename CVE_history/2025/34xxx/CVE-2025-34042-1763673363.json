      "oldValue": "An authenticated command injection vulnerability exists in the Beward N100 IP Camera firmware version M2.1.6.04C014 via the ServerName and TimeZone parameters in the servetest CGI page. An attacker with access to the web interface can inject arbitrary system commands into these parameters, which are unsafely embedded into backend system calls without proper input sanitization. Successful exploitation results in remote code execution with root privileges. Exploitation evidence was observed by the Shadowserver Foundation on 2025-07-04 UTC.",
