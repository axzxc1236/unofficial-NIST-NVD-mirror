      "type": "Description",
      "newValue": "Wazuh's File Integrity Monitoring (FIM), when configured with automatic threat removal, contains a time-of-check/time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition that can allow a local, low-privileged attacker to cause the Wazuh service (running as NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM) to delete attacker-controlled files or paths. The root cause is insufficient synchronization and lack of robust final-path validation in the threat-removal workflow: the agent records an active-response action and proceeds to perform deletion without guaranteeing the deletion target is the originally intended file. This can result in SYSTEM-level arbitrary file or folder deletion and consequent local privilege escalation. Wazuh made an attempted fix via pull request 8697 on 2025-07-10, but that change was incomplete."
