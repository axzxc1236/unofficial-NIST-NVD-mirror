These components are present across many container images and increase the product's attack surface, enabling exploitation chains when leveraged by an attacker. Multiple distinct EOL versions and unpatched libraries across containers; Nginx binaries date from 2019 in several images and Laravel versions observed include EOL releases (for example Laravel 5.5.x, 5.7.x, 5.8.x).",
