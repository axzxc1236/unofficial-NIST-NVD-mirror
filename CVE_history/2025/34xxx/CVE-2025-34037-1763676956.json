      "type": "Description",
      "oldValue": "An OS command injection vulnerability exists in various models of E-Series Linksys routers via the /tmUnblock.cgi and /hndUnblock.cgi endpoints over HTTP on port 8080. The CGI scripts improperly process user-supplied input passed to the ttcp_ip parameter without sanitization, allowing unauthenticated attackers to inject shell commands. This vulnerability is exploited in the wild by the \"TheMoon\" worm to deploy a MIPS ELF payload, enabling arbitrary code execution on the router. This vulnerability may affect other Linksys products to include, but not limited to, WAG/WAP/WES/WET/WRT-series router models and Wireless-N access points and routers. Exploitation evidence was observed by the Shadowserver Foundation on 2025-07-13 UTC.",
