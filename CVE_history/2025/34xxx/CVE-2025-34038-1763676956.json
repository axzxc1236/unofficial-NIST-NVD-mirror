      "oldValue": "A SQL injection vulnerability exists in Fanwei e-cology 8.0 via the getdata.jsp endpoint. The application directly passes unsanitized user input from the sql parameter into a database query within the getSelectAllIds(sql, type) method, reachable through the cmd=getSelectAllId workflow in the AjaxManager. This allows unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially exposing sensitive data such as administrator password hashes. Exploitation evidence was observed by the Shadowserver Foundation on 2025-07-13 UTC.",
