      "oldValue": "Genymobile/scrcpy versions up to and including 3.3.3 and prior to commit 3e40b24 contain a global buffer overflow vulnerability in the function sc_read32be, invoked via sc_device_msg_deserialize() and process_msgs(). Processing crafted device messages can cause reads beyond the bounds of a global buffer, leading to memory corruption or crashes. This vulnerability can be exploited to cause a denial of service and, under certain conditions, may be leveraged for further exploitation depending on the execution environment and available mitigations.",
      "newValue": "Genymobile/scrcpy versions up to and including 3.3.3, prior to commit 3e40b24, contain a buffer overflow vulnerability in the sc_device_msg_deserialize() function. A compromised device can send crafted messages that cause out-of-bounds reads, which may result in memory corruption or a denial-of-service condition. This vulnerability may allow further exploitation on the host system."
