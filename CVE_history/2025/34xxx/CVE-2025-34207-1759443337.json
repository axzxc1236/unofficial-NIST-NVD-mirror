These settings disable verification of the remote host’s SSH key and automatically forward the developer’s SSH‑agent to any host that matches the configured wildcard patterns.  As a result, an attacker who can reach a single compromised container can cause the container to connect to a malicious SSH server, capture the forwarded private keys, and use those keys for unrestricted lateral movement across the environment.",
