      "oldValue": "A path traversal vulnerability exists in the web management interface of D-Link DSL-2730U, DSL-2750U, and DSL-2750E ADSL routers with firmware versions IN_1.02, SEA_1.04, and SEA_1.07. The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation on the getpage parameter within the /cgi-bin/webproc CGI script. This flaw allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to perform path traversal attacks by supplying crafted requests, enabling arbitrary file read on the affected device.",
