This web management interface can be used by administrators to control product\nfeatures, setup network switching, and register license among other features. The application has been developed in PHP with the webEASY SDK, also named ‘ewb’ by Evertz.\n\nThis web interface has two endpoints that are vulnerable to arbitrary command injection and the authentication mechanism has a flaw leading to authentication bypass.\n\nRemote unauthenticated attackers can gain arbitrary command execution with elevated privileges ( root ) on affected devices.\n\nThis level of access could lead to serious business impact such as the interruption of media streaming, modification of media being streamed, alteration of closed captions being generated, among others.",
