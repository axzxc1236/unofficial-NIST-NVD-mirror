      "type": "Description",
      "newValue": "A vulnerability exists in the NodeRestriction admission controller where nodes can bypass dynamic resource allocation authorization checks. When the DynamicResourceAllocation feature gate is enabled, the controller properly validates resource claim statuses during pod status updates but fails to perform equivalent validation during pod creation. This allows a compromised node to create mirror pods that access unauthorized dynamic resources, potentially leading to privilege escalation."
