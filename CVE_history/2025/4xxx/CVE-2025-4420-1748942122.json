      "newValue": "The Vayu Blocks – Gutenberg Blocks for WordPress & WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the ‘containerWidth’ parameter in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.1 due to a missing capability check on the vayu_blocks_option_panel_callback() function and insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page."
