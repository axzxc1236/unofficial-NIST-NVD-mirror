      "newValue": "Due to the lack of randomness in assigning Object Identifiers in the SAP NetWeaver AS JAVA IIOP service, an authenticated attacker with low privileges could predict the identifiers by conducting a brute force search. By leveraging knowledge of several identifiers generated close to the same time, the attacker could determine a desired identifier which could enable them to access limited system information. This poses a low risk to confidentiality without impacting the integrity or availability of the service."
