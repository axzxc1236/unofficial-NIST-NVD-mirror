      "newValue": "The AuthKit library for React Router 7+ provides helpers for authentication and session management using WorkOS & AuthKit with React Router. In versions 0.6.1 and below, @workos-inc/authkit-react-router exposed sensitive authentication artifacts â€” specifically sealedSession and accessToken by returning them from the authkitLoader. This caused them to be rendered into the browser HTML. This issue is fixed in version 0.7.0."
