      "newValue": "TCL 65C655 Smart TV, running firmware version V8-R75PT01-LF1V269.001116 (Android TV, Kernel 5.4.242+), is vulnerable to a blind, unauthenticated Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability via the UPnP MediaRenderer service (AVTransport:1). The device accepts unauthenticated SetAVTransportURI SOAP requests over TCP/16398 and attempts to retrieve externally referenced URIs, including attacker-controlled payloads. The blind SSRF allows for sending requests on behalf of the TV, which can be leveraged to probe for other internal or external services accessible by the device (e.g., 127.0.0.1:16XXX, LAN services, or internet targets), potentially enabling additional exploit chains."
