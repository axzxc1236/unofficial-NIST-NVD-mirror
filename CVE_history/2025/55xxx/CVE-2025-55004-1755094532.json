      "newValue": "ImageMagick is free and open-source software used for editing and manipulating digital images. Prior to version 7.1.2-1, ImageMagick is vulnerable to heap-buffer overflow read around the handling of images with separate alpha channels when performing image magnification in ReadOneMNGIMage.
