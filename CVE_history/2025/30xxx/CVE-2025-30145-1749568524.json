      "newValue": "GeoServer is an open source server that allows users to share and edit geospatial data. Malicious Jiffle scripts can be executed by GeoServer, either as a rendering transformation in WMS dynamic styles or as a WPS process, that can enter an infinite loop to trigger denial of service. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.27.0, 2.26.3, and 2.25.7. This vulnerability can be mitigated by disabling WMS dynamic styling and  the Jiffle process."
