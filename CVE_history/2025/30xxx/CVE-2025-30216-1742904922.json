      "newValue": "CryptoLib provides a software-only solution using the CCSDS Space Data Link Security Protocol - Extended Procedures (SDLS-EP) to secure communications between a spacecraft running the core Flight System (cFS) and a ground station. In versions 1.3.3 and prior, a Heap Overflow vulnerability occurs in the `Crypto_TM_ProcessSecurity` function (`crypto_tm.c:1735:8`). When processing the Secondary Header Length of a TM protocol packet, if the Secondary Header Length exceeds the packet's total length, a heap overflow is triggered during the memcpy operation that copies packet data into the dynamically allocated buffer `p_new_dec_frame`. This allows an attacker to overwrite adjacent heap memory, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or system instability. A patch is available at commit 810fd66d592c883125272fef123c3240db2f170f."
