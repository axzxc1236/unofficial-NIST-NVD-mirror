This issue affects the latest master branch version 3.47.0.99999. The vulnerability arises from the ability to bypass regular expression filters intended to prevent malicious parameter injection in JDBC connections. Attackers can manipulate spaces between parameters to evade detection, allowing for unauthorized file access and code execution. The vulnerability is addressed in version 3.46.0.8."
