      "newValue": "An Execution with Unnecessary Privileges vulnerability has been identified in Moxaâ€™s network security appliances and routers. A flaw in broken access control has been identified in the /api/v1/setting/data endpoint of the affected device. This flaw allows a low-privileged authenticated user to call the API without the required permissions, thereby gaining the ability to access or modify system configuration data. Successful exploitation may lead to privilege escalation, allowing the attacker to access or modify sensitive system settings. While the overall impact is high, there is no loss of confidentiality or integrity within any subsequent systems."
