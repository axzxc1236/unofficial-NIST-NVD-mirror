      "oldValue": "On  open-vsx.org https://open-vsx.org/  it was possible to run an arbitrary build scripts for auto-published extensions because of missing sandboxing of CI job runs.  An attacker who had access to an existing extension could take over the service account of the marketplace. The issue has been fixed on June 24th, 2025 and the vulnerable code present in the publish-extension code repository.",
      "newValue": "A vulnerability in the Eclipse Open VSX Registry’s automated publishing system could have allowed unauthorized uploads of extensions. Specifically, the system’s build scripts were executed without proper isolation, potentially exposing a privileged token. This token enabled the publishing of new extension versions under any namespace, including those not controlled by an attacker. However, it did not permit deletion of existing extensions, overwriting of published versions, or access to administrative features of the registry.\n\nThe issue was reported on May 4, 2025, fully resolved by June 24, and followed by a comprehensive audit. No evidence of compromise was found, though 81 extensions were proactively deactivated as a precaution. The standard publishing process remained unaffected. Recommendations have been issued to mitigate similar risks in the future."
