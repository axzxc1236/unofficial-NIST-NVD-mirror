      "newValue": "An Execution with Unnecessary Privileges vulnerability has been identified in Moxaâ€™s network security appliances and routers. A critical authorization flaw in the API allows an authenticated, low-privileged user to create a new administrator account, including accounts with usernames identical to existing users. In certain scenarios, this vulnerability could allow an attacker to gain full administrative control over the affected device, leading to potential account impersonation. While successful exploitation can severely impact the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the affected device itself, there is no loss of confidentiality or integrity within any subsequent systems."
