      "newValue": "An Execution with Unnecessary Privileges vulnerability has been identified in Moxa’s network security appliances and routers. A flaw in the API authorization logic of the affected device allows an authenticated, low-privileged user to execute the administrative `ping` function, which is restricted to higher-privileged roles. This vulnerability enables the user to perform internal network reconnaissance, potentially discovering internal hosts or services that would otherwise be inaccessible. Repeated exploitation could lead to minor resource consumption. While the overall impact is limited, it may result in some loss of confidentiality and availability on the affected device. There is no impact on the integrity of the device, and the vulnerability does not affect any subsequent systems."
