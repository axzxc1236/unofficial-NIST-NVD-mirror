      "type": "Description",
      "newValue": "A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the upload.cgi module of the iptime NAS firmware v1.5.04. The vulnerability arises due to the unsafe use of the strcpy function to copy attacker-controlled data from the CONTENT_TYPE HTTP header into a fixed-size stack buffer (v8, allocated 8 bytes) without bounds checking. Since this operation occurs before authentication logic is executed, the vulnerability is exploitable pre-authentication."
