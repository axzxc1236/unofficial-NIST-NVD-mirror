      "newValue": "An issue was discovered in CS Cart 4.18.3 allows the vendor login functionality lacks essential security controls such as CAPTCHA verification and rate limiting. This allows an attacker to systematically attempt various combinations of usernames and passwords (brute-force attack) to gain unauthorized access to vendor accounts. The absence of any blocking mechanism makes the login endpoint susceptible to automated attacks."
