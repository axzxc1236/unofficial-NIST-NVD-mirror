      "newValue": "A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the Altium Forum due to missing server-side input sanitization in forum post content. An authenticated attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript into forum posts, which is stored and executed when other users view the affected post.\nSuccessful exploitation allows the attacker’s payload to execute in the context of the victim’s authenticated Altium 365 session, enabling unauthorized access to workspace data, including design files and workspace settings. Exploitation requires user interaction to view a malicious forum post."
