      "newValue": "The AIKTP plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to missing authorization checks on the /aiktp/getToken REST API endpoint in all versions up to, and including, 5.0.04. The endpoint uses the 'verify_user_logged_in' as a permission callback, which only checks if a user is logged in, but fails to verify if the user has administrative capabilities. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with Subscriber-level access and above to retrieve the administrator's 'aiktpz_token' access token, which can then be used to create posts, upload media library files, and access private content as the administrator."
