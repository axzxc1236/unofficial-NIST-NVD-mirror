      "newValue": "The Simple calendar for Elementor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Missing Authorization in all versions up to, and including, 1.6.6. This is due to missing capability checks on the `miga_ajax_editor_cal_delete` function that is hooked to the `miga_editor_cal_delete` AJAX action with both authenticated and unauthenticated access enabled. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary calendar entries by sending a request with a valid nonce and the calendar entry ID."
