      "type": "Description",
      "newValue": "A flaw was found in Glib's content type parsing logic. This buffer underflow vulnerability occurs because the length of a header line is stored in a signed integer, which can lead to integer wraparound for very large inputs. This results in pointer underflow and out-of-bounds memory access. Exploitation requires a local user to install or process a specially crafted treemagic file, which can lead to local denial of service or application instability."
