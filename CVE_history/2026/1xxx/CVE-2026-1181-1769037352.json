      "oldValue": "A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the Altium Forum due to missing server-side input sanitization in forum post content. An authenticated attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript into forum posts, which is stored and executed when other users view the affected post.\nSuccessful exploitation allows the attacker’s payload to execute in the context of the victim’s authenticated Altium 365 session, enabling unauthorized access to workspace data, including design files and workspace settings. Exploitation requires user interaction to view a malicious forum post.",
      "newValue": "Altium 365 workspace endpoints were configured with an overly permissive Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policy that allowed credentialed cross-origin requests from other Altium-controlled subdomains, including forum.live.altium.com. As a result, JavaScript executing on those origins could access authenticated workspace APIs in the context of a logged-in user. When chained with vulnerabilities in those external applications, this misconfiguration enables unauthorized access to workspace data, administrative actions, and bypass of IP allowlisting controls, including in GovCloud environments."
