      "newValue": "The Forms Bridge – Infinite integrations plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the 'id' shortcode attribute in the 'financoop_campaign' shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 4.2.5. This is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on the user-supplied 'id' parameter in the forms_bridge_financoop_shortcode_error function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page."
