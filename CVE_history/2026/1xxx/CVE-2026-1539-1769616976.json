      "type": "Description",
      "newValue": "A flaw was found in the libsoup HTTP library that can cause proxy authentication credentials to be sent to unintended destinations. When handling HTTP redirects, libsoup removes the Authorization header but does not remove the Proxy-Authorization header if the request is redirected to a different host. As a result, sensitive proxy credentials may be leaked to third-party servers. Applications using libsoup for HTTP communication may unintentionally expose proxy authentication data."
