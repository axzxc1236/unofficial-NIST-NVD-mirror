      "newValue": "The MetForm – Contact Form, Survey, Quiz, & Custom Form Builder for Elementor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Sensitive Information Exposure in versions up to, and including, 4.1.0. This is due to the use of a forgeable cookie value derived only from the entry ID and current user ID without a server-side secret. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to access form submission entry data via MetForm shortcodes for entries created within the transient TTL (default is 15 minutes)."
