This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Upsonic. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the add_tool endpoint, which listens on TCP port 7541 by default. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in deserialization of untrusted data. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the service account. Was ZDI-CAN-26845."
