      "newValue": "SummaryA command injection vulnerability (CWE-78) has been found to exist in the `wrangler pages deploy` command. The issue occurs because the `--commit-hash` parameter is passed directly to a shell command without proper validation or sanitization, allowing an attacker with control of `--commit-hash` to execute arbitrary commands on the system running Wrangler.\n\n\n\n\nRoot causeThe commitHash variable, derived from user input via the --commit-hash CLI argument, is interpolated directly into a shell command using template literals (e.g.,  execSync(`git show -s --format=%B ${commitHash}`)). Shell metacharacters are interpreted by the shell, enabling command execution.\n\n\n\n\nImpactThis vulnerability is generally hard to exploit, as it requires --commit-hash to be attacker controlled. The vulnerability primarily affects CI/CD environments where `wrangler pages deploy` is used in automated pipelines and the \n\n--commit-hash parameter is populated from external, potentially untrusted sources. An attacker could exploit this to:\n\n  *  Run any shell command.\n  *  Exfiltrate environment variables.\n  *  Compromise the CI runner to install backdoors or modify build artifacts.\n\n\n\nCredits Disclosed responsibly by kny4hacker.\n\n\n\n\nMitigation\n  *  Wrangler v4 users are requested to upgrade to Wrangler v4.59.1 or higher.\n  *  Wrangler v3 users are requested to upgrade to Wrangler v3.114.17 or higher.\n  *  Users on Wrangler v2 (EOL) should upgrade to a supported major version."
