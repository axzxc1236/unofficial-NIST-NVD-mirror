      "newValue": "A flaw was found in glib. Missing validation of offset and count parameters in the g_buffered_input_stream_peek() function can lead to an integer overflow during length calculation. When specially crafted values are provided, this overflow results in an incorrect size being passed to memcpy(), triggering a buffer overflow. This can cause application crashes, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS)."
