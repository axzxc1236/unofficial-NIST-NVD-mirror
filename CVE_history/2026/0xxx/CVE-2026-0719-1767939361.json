      "type": "Description",
      "oldValue": "A flaw was found in libsoup's NTLM (NT LAN Manager) authentication module. When NTLM authentication is enabled, a local attacker can exploit a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability in the md4sum() function. This allows the attacker to overwrite adjacent memory, which may result in arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the affected application.",
      "newValue": "A flaw was identified in the NTLM authentication handling of the libsoup HTTP library, used by GNOME and other applications for network communication. When processing extremely long passwords, an internal size calculation can overflow due to improper use of signed integers. This results in incorrect memory allocation on the stack, followed by unsafe memory copying. As a result, applications using libsoup may crash unexpectedly, creating a denial-of-service risk."
