      "newValue": "OpenProject is an open-source, web-based project management software. Versions 16.3.0 through 16.6.4 are affected by a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability in the Roadmap view. OpenProject’s roadmap view renders the “Related work packages” list for each version. When a version contains work packages from a different project (e.g., a subproject), the helper link_to_work_package prepends package.project.to_s to the link and returns the entire string with .html_safe. Because project names are user-controlled and no escaping happens before calling html_safe, any HTML placed in a subproject name is injected verbatim into the page. The underlying issue is mitigated in versions 16.6.5 and 17.0.0 by setting a `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` header, which was in place until a refactoring move to Rails standard content-security policy, which did not properly apply this header in the new configuration since OpenProject 16.3.0. Those who cannot upgrade their installations should ensure that they add a X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff header in their proxying web application server."
