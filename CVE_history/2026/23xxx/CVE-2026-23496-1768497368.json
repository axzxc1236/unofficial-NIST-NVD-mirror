Prior to 5.2.2 and 6.1.1, the application fails to enforce proper server-side authorization checks on the API endpoint responsible for managing \"Favourite Output Channel Configurations.\" Testing revealed that an authenticated backend user without explicitely lacking permissions for this feature was still able to successfully invoke the endpoint and modify or retrieve these configurations. This vulnerability is fixed in 5.2.2 and 6.1.1."
