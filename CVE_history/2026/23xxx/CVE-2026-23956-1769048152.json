In versions 1.4.0\nand below, overriding RegExp serialization with extremely large patterns can exhaust JavaScript runtime memory during deserialization. Additionally, overriding RegExp serialization with patterns that trigger catastrophic backtracking can lead to ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service).
