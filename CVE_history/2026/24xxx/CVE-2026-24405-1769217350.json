Versions 2.3.1.1 and below have a Heap Buffer Overflow vulnerability in CIccMpeCalculator::Read(). This occurs when user-controllable input is unsafely incorporated into ICC profile data or other structured binary blobs. Successful exploitation may allow an attacker to perform DoS, manipulate data, bypass application logic and Code Execution. This issue has been fixed in version 2.3.1.2."
