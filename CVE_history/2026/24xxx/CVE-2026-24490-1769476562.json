      "newValue": "MobSF is a mobile application security testing tool used. Prior to version 4.4.5, a Stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in MobSF's Android manifest analysis allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of a victim's browser session by uploading a malicious APK. The `android:host` attribute from `<data android:scheme=\"android_secret_code\">` elements is rendered in HTML reports without sanitization, enabling session hijacking and account takeover. Version 4.4.5 fixes the issue."
