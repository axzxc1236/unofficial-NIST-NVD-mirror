      "newValue": "Hono is a Web application framework that provides support for any JavaScript runtime. Prior to version 4.11.7, IP Restriction Middleware in Hono is vulnerable to an IP address validation bypass. The `IPV4_REGEX` pattern and `convertIPv4ToBinary` function in `src/utils/ipaddr.ts` do not properly validate that IPv4 octet values are within the valid range of 0-255, allowing attackers to craft malformed IP addresses that bypass IP-based access controls. Version 4.11.7 contains a patch for the issue."
