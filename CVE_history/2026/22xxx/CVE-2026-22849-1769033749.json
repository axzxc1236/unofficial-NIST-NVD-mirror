      "newValue": "Saleor is an e-commerce platform. Starting in version 3.0.0 and prior to versions 3.20.108, 3.21.43, and 3.22.27, Saleor was allowing users to modify rich text fields with HTML without running any backend HTML cleaners thus allowing malicious actors to perform stored XSS attacks on dashboards and storefronts. Malicious staff members could craft script injections to target other staff members, possibly stealing their access and/or refresh tokens. This issue has been patched in versions 3.22.27, 3.21.43, and 3.20.108. In case of inability to upgrade straight away, a possible workaround is to use client-side cleaner."
