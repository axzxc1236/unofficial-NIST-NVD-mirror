      "newValue": "5ire is a cross-platform desktop artificial intelligence assistant and model context protocol client. Prior to version 0.15.3, an unsafe HTML rendering permits untrusted HTML (including on* event attributes) to execute in the renderer context. An attacker can inject an `<img onerror=...>` payload to run arbitrary JavaScript in the renderer, which can call exposed bridge APIs such as `window.bridge.mcpServersManager.createServer`. This enables unauthorized creation of MCP servers and lead to remote command execution. Version 0.15.3 fixes the issue."
