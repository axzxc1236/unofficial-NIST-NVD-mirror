      "newValue": "Soft Serve is a self-hostable Git server for the command line. Prior to version 0.11.2, an authorization bypass in the LFS lock deletion endpoint allows any authenticated user with repository write access to delete locks owned by other users by setting the force flag. The vulnerable code path processes force deletions before retrieving user context, bypassing ownership validation entirely. This issue has been patched in version 0.11.2."
