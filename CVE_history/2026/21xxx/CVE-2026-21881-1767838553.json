      "newValue": "Kanboard is project management software focused on Kanban methodology. Versions 1.2.48 and below is vulnerable to a critical authentication bypass when REVERSE_PROXY_AUTH is enabled. The application blindly trusts HTTP headers for user authentication without verifying the request originated from a trusted reverse proxy. An attacker can impersonate any user, including administrators, by simply sending a spoofed HTTP header. This issue is fixed in version 1.2.49."
