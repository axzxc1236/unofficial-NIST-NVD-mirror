Specifically, only BIG-IP Virtual Server with \"SSL Forward Proxy\" setting enabled in both the assigned Client and Server SSL profiles deployments are impacted by this issue. Customers with use cases which the \"SSL Forward Proxy\" setup connects to untrusted servers are at highest risk while customers with use cases which the \"SSL Forward Proxy\" setup connects to trusted servers have a lower risk.",
