      "oldValue": "The Intel Puma 5, 6, and 7 chips, as used on NETGEAR C6300, CM400, CM700, and CMD31T devices, allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (performance degradation) by sending a moderate volume of small packets to many TCP or UDP ports. NOTE: Intel has advised that they are only a hardware manufacturer in this instance; they do NOT own the mitigation distribution channel for these chips. Any details about mitigations would need to come from NETGEAR.",
      "newValue": "** REJECT **  DO NOT USE THIS CANDIDATE NUMBER.  ConsultIDs: none.  Reason: This candidate was withdrawn by its CNA.  Further investigation showed that it was not a security issue associated with the originally named downstream provider.  Notes: none."
