      "oldValue": "** DISPUTED ** The deserialize function in serialize-to-js through 1.1.1 allows attackers to bypass intended access restrictions via vectors involving a \"function()\" substring, as demonstrated by a \"function(){console.log(\" call. NOTE: The vendor states 'In my understanding [this attack] just runs inside a \"sandbox\" and prints ... to a tty.'",
      "newValue": "** DISPUTED ** The deserialize function in serialize-to-js through 1.1.1 allows attackers to cause a denial of service via vectors involving an Immediately Invoked Function Expression \"function()\" substring, as demonstrated by a \"function(){console.log(\" call or a simple infinite loop. NOTE: the vendor agrees that denial of service can occur but notes that deserialize is explicitly listed as \"harmful\" within the README.md file."
