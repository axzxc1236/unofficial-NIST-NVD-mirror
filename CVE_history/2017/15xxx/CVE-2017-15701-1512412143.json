A remote unauthenticated attacker could exploit this to cause the broker to exhaust all available memory and eventually terminate. Older AMQP protocols are not affected.",

A remote unauthenticated attacker could exploit this to cause the broker to exhaust all available memory and eventually terminate.  Older AMQP protocols are not affected."
