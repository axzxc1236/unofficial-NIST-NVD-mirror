      "oldValue": "In PyJWT 1.5.0 and below the 'invalid_strings' check in 'HMACAlgorithm.prepare_key' does not account for all PEM encoded public keys. Specifically, the PKCS1 PEM encoded format would be allowed because it is prefaced with the string '-----BEGIN RSA PUBLIC KEY-----' which is not accounted for. This enables symmetric/asymmetric key confusion attacks against users using the PKCS1 PEM encoded public keys, which would allow an attacker to craft JWTs from scratch.",

Notes: All CVE users should reference CVE-2017-11424 instead of this candidate.  All references and descriptions in this candidate have been removed to prevent accidental usage."
