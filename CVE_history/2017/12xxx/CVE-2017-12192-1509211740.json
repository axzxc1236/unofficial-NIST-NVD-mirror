      "oldValue": "A vulnerability was found in the Key Management sub component of the Linux kernel, where when trying to issue a KEYTCL_READ on negative key would lead to a NULL pointer dereference. A local attacker could use this flaw to crash the kernel.",
      "newValue": "The keyctl_read_key function in security/keys/keyctl.c in the Key Management subcomponent in the Linux kernel before 4.13.5 does not properly consider that a key may be possessed but negatively instantiated, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (OOPS and system crash) via a crafted KEYCTL_READ operation."
