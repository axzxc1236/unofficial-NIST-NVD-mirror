      "type": "Description",
      "oldValue": "The nested_vmx_check_vmptr function in arch/x86/kvm/vmx.c in the Linux kernel through 4.9.8 improperly emulates the VMXON instruction, which allows KVM L1 guest OS users to cause a denial of service (host OS memory consumption) by leveraging the mishandling of page references.",
      "newValue": "Linux kernel built with the KVM visualization support (CONFIG_KVM), with nested visualization(nVMX) feature enabled(nested=1), is vulnerable to host memory leakage issue. It could occur while emulating VMXON instruction in 'handle_vmon'. An L1 guest user could use this flaw to leak host memory potentially resulting in DoS."
