      "oldValue": "The ping_unhash function in net/ipv4/ping.c in the Linux kernel through 4.10.8 is too late in obtaining a certain lock and consequently cannot ensure that disconnect function calls are safe, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (panic) by leveraging access to the protocol value of IPPROTO_ICMP in a socket system call.",
      "newValue": "A race condition leading to a NULL pointer dereference was found in the Linux kernel's Link Layer Control implementation. A local attacker with access to ping sockets could use this flaw to crash the system."
