      "oldValue": "libgcrypt before version 1.7.8 is vulnerable to a to cache side-channel attack resulting into a complete break of RSA-1024 while using the left-to-right method for computing the sliding-window expansion. The same attack is believed to work on RSA-2048 with moderately more computation. This side-channel requires that attacker can run arbitrary software on the hardware where the private RSA key is used.",
