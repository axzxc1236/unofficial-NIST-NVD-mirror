      "type": "Description",
      "oldValue": "A flaw was found in the way Linux kernel allocates heap memory to build the scattergather list from a fragment list(skb_shinfo(skb)->frag_list) in the socket buffer(skb_buff). The heap overflow occurred if 'MAX_SKB_FRAGS + 1' parameter and 'NETIF_F_FRAGLIST' feature are both used together. A remote user or process could use this flaw to potentially escalate their privilege on a system.",
      "newValue": "Heap-based buffer overflow in drivers/net/macsec.c in the MACsec module in the Linux kernel through 4.10.12 allows attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact by leveraging the use of a MAX_SKB_FRAGS+1 size in conjunction with the NETIF_F_FRAGLIST feature, leading to an error in the skb_to_sgvec function."
