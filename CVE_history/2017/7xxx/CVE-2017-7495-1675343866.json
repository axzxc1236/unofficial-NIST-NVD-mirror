      "oldValue": "fs/ext4/inode.c in the Linux kernel before 4.6.2, when ext4 data=ordered mode is used, mishandles a needs-flushing-before-commit list, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information from other users' files in opportunistic circumstances by waiting for a hardware reset, creating a new file, making write system calls, and reading this file.",
      "newValue": "A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel where filesystems mounted with data=ordered mode may allow an attacker to read stale data from recently allocated blocks in new files after a system 'reset' by abusing ext4 mechanics of delayed allocation."
