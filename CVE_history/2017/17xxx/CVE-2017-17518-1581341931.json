NOTE: This issue is being disputed as not being a vulnerability because ?the current version of white_dune (1.369 at https://wdune.ourproject.org/) do not use a \"BROWSER environment variable\". Instead, the \"browser\" variable is read from the $HOME/.dunerc file (or from the M$Windows registry). It is configurable in the \"options\" menu. The default is chosen in the ./configure script, which tests various programs, first tested is \"xdg-open\".?",
