      "newValue": "According to https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/739007:\nThe P1735 IEEE standard describes methods for encrypting electronic-design intellectual property (IP), as well as the management of access rights for such IP. The methods are flawed and, in the most egregious cases, enable attack vectors that allow recovery of the entire underlying plaintext IP. Implementations of IEEE P1735 may be weak to cryptographic attacks that allow an attacker to obtain plaintext intellectual property without the key, among other impacts.\n<br />\n\nCommercial electronic design automation (EDA) tools that utilize the P1735 standard, or products designed with such EDA tools may be vulnerable.\n<br />\nThe CPE configuration provided is likely not inclusive of all vulnerable products.  Please contact the vendor of your product for more information."
