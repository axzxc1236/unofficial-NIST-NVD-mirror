By simulating a specific BGP session restart, an attacker can repeatedly crash the RPD process causing prolonged denial of service (DoS). \nGraceful restart helper mode for BGP is enabled by default.\nNo other Juniper Networks products or platforms are affected by this issue.\n\n\n\nAffected releases are Juniper Networks Junos OS:\n16.1 versions prior to 16.1R7;\n16.1X65 versions prior to 16.1X65-D48;\n16.2 versions prior to 16.2R2-S8;\n17.1 versions prior to 17.1R2-S7, 17.1R3;\n17.2 versions prior to 17.2R1-S7, 17.2R3;\n17.2X75 versions prior to 17.2X75-D92, 17.2X75-D102, 17.2X75-D110;\n17.3 versions prior to 17.3R2-S2, 17.3R3;\n17.4 versions prior to 17.4R1-S4, 17.4R2;\n18.1 versions prior to 18.1R2.\n\nJunos OS releases prior to 16.1R1 are not affected.",
