An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could cause a target system to stop responding.\nTo exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would have to log on to an affected system and run a specially crafted application. The vulnerability would not allow an attacker to execute code or to elevate user rights directly, but it could be used to cause a target system to stop responding.\nThe update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Windows handles objects in memory.\n"
