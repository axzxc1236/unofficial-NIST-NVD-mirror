      "oldValue": "embed/ephy-web-view.c in GNOME Web (aka Epiphany) through 3.31.4 allows address bar spoofing because a page load triggered by JavaScript leads to updating an address as if it were triggered by a safer visit type (e.g., VISIT_LINK, VISIT_TYPED, VISIT_BOOKMARK, or VISIT_HOMEPAGE). This is similar to the CVE-2018-8383 issue in Microsoft Edge.",
      "newValue": "WebKitGTK and WPE WebKit prior to version 2.24.1 are vulnerable to address bar spoofing upon certain JavaScript redirections. An attacker could cause malicious web content to be displayed as if for a trusted URI. This is similar to the CVE-2018-8383 issue in Microsoft Edge."
