Specially crafted network packets sent to affected devices on port 4840/tcp could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to cause a Denial-of-Service condition of the OPC communication or crash the device. The security vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker with network access to the affected systems. Successful exploitation requires no system privileges and no user interaction. An attacker could use the vulnerability to compromise availability of the OPC communication. At the time of advisory publication no public exploitation of this security vulnerability was known.",
