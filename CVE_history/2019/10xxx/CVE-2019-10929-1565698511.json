An attacker in a Man-in-the-Middle position could potentially modify network traffic exchanged on port 102/tcp, due to certain properties in the calculation used for integrity protection.\n\nIn order to exploit the vulnerability, an attacker must be able to perform a Man-in-the-Middle attack. The vulnerability could impact the integrity of the communication.\n\nNo public exploitation of the vulnerability was known at the time of advisory publication.",
