SIPLUS variants) (All versions <= V4.4), SIMATIC S7-1500 CPU family (incl. related ET200 CPUs and SIPLUS variants), excluding CPU 1518-4 PN/DP and CPU 1518 MFP (and related SIPLUS variant) (All versions <= V2.8.1), SIMATIC S7-1500 Software Controller (All versions), SIMATIC STEP 7 (TIA Portal) (All versions < V16), SIMATIC WinCC (TIA Portal) (All versions < V16), SIMATIC WinCC OA (All versions <= 3.15), SIMATIC WinCC OA (All versions <= 3.16 patch version 12), SIMATIC WinCC Runtime Advanced (All versions), SIMATIC WinCC Runtime Professional (All versions), TIM 1531 IRC (incl. SIPLUS NET variants) (All versions < V2.1), TIM 1531 IRC (incl. SIPLUS variant) (All versions). An attacker in a Man-in-the-Middle position could potentially modify network traffic exchanged on port 102/tcp to PLCs of the SIMATIC S7-1200, SIMATIC S7-1500 and SIMATIC SoftwareController CPU families, due to certain properties in the calculation used for integrity protection. In order to exploit the vulnerability, an attacker must be able to perform a Man-in-the-Middle attack. The vulnerability could impact the integrity of the communication. No public exploitation of the vulnerability was known at the time of advisory publication.",
