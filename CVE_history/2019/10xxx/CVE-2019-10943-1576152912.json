SIPLUS variants) Open Controller CPU 1515SP PC2 (All versions), SIMATIC S7 PLCSIM Advanced (All versions <= V3.0), SIMATIC S7-1200 CPU family (incl. SIPLUS variants) (All versions <= V4.4), SIMATIC S7-1500 CPU family (incl. related ET200 CPUs and SIPLUS variants), excluding CPU 1518-4 PN/DP and CPU 1518 MFP (and related SIPLUS variant) (All versions <= V2.8.1), SIMATIC S7-1500 Software Controller (All versions). An attacker with network access to port 102/tcp could potentially modify the\nuser program on the PLC in a way that the running code is different from the\nsource code which is stored on the device.\n\nAn attacker must have network access to affected devices and must be able to\nperform changes to the user program. The vulnerability could impact the\nperceived integrity of the user program stored on the CPU. An engineer that\ntries to obtain the code of the user program running on the device, can\nreceive different source code that is not actually running on the device.\n\nNo public exploitation of the vulnerability was known at the time of advisory\npublication.",
