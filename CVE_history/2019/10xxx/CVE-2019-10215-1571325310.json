      "oldValue": "A flaw was found, in all versions prior to ghostscript 9.28, in the .setuserparams2 procedure where it did not properly secure its privileged calls, enabling scripts to bypass `-dSAFER` restrictions. A specially crafted PostScript file could disable security protection and then have access to the file system, or execute arbitrary commands.",
      "newValue": "Bootstrap-3-Typeahead after version 4.0.2 is vulnerable to a cross-site scripting flaw in the highlighter() function. An attacker could exploit this via user interaction to execute code in the user's browser."
