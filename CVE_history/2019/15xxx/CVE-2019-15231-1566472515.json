      "oldValue": "Webmin 1.890, in a default installation, contains a backdoor that allows an unauthenticated attacker to remotely execute commands. This CVE only refers to the backdoor that was enabled by default, and therefore is a separate CVE from CVE-2019-15107. NOTE: although the vendor's build infrastructure was compromised in 2018, the compromise is not known to affect any GitHub repository. Thus, the relatively uncommon case of an end user building their own copy of Webmin (from the 1.890 tag on GitHub) is thought to be safe.",
      "newValue": "** REJECT ** DO NOT USE THIS CANDIDATE NUMBER. ConsultIDs: CVE-2019-15107. Reason: This candidate is a duplicate of CVE-2019-15107. Notes: All CVE users should reference CVE-2019-15107 instead of this candidate. All references and descriptions in this candidate have been removed to prevent accidental usage."
