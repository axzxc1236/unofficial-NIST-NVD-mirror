To copy files from a container, Kubernetes creates a tar inside the container, copies it over the network, and kubectl unpacks it on the user’s machine.\n\nIf the tar binary in the container is malicious, it could run any code and output unexpected, malicious results. An attacker could use this to write files to any path on the user’s machine when kubectl cp is called, limited only by the system permissions of the local user.\n\nThe untar function can both create and follow symbolic links.\n\nThe issue is resolved in kubectl v1.11.9, v1.12.7, v1.13.5, and v1.14.0.",
