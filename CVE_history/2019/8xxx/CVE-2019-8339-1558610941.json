A bypass allows local users to run malicious code without being detected because record_event_consumer in driver/main.c in sysdig-probe.ko (and falco-probe.ko) mishandles a free space calculation.",
      "newValue": "An issue was discovered in Falco through 0.14.0. A missing indicator for insufficient resources allows local users to bypass the detection engine."
