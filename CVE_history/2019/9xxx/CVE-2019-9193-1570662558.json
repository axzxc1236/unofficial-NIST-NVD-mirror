This functionality is enabled by default and can be abused to run arbitrary operating system commands on Windows, Linux, and macOS. NOTE: Third parties claim/state this is not an issue because PostgreSQL functionality for ?COPY TO/FROM PROGRAM? is acting as intended. References state that in PostgreSQL, a superuser can execute commands as the server user without using the ?COPY FROM PROGRAM?.",
