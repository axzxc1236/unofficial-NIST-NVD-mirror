      "newValue": "A denial of service vulnerability exists in Skype for Business. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could cause Skype for Business to stop responding. Note that the denial of service would not allow an attacker to execute code or to elevate the attacker's user rights.\nTo exploit the vulnerability, an attacker needs to obtain a dial-in link for a vulnerable server and then initiates a series of calls within a short amount of time.\nThe update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the way that Skype for Business server handles objects in memory."
