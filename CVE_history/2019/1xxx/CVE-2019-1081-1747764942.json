      "newValue": "An information disclosure vulnerability exists when affected Microsoft browsers improperly handle objects in memory. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could obtain information to further compromise the userâ€™s system.\nTo exploit the vulnerability, in a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a website that is used to attempt to exploit the vulnerability. In addition, compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit the vulnerability. However, in all cases an attacker would have no way to force a user to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince a user to take action. For example, an attacker could trick a user into clicking a link that takes the user to the attacker's site.\nThe security update addresses the vulnerability by modifying how Microsoft browsers handle objects in memory."
