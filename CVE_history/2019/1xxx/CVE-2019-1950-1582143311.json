      "oldValue": "A vulnerability in the firmware of the Cisco UCS C-Series Rack Servers could allow an authenticated, physical attacker to bypass Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) Secure Boot validation checks and load a compromised software image on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to improper validation of the server firmware upgrade images. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by installing a server firmware version that would allow the attacker to disable UEFI Secure Boot. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass the signature validation checks that are done by UEFI Secure Boot technology and load a compromised software image on the affected device. A compromised software image is any software image that has not been digitally signed by Cisco.",
      "newValue": "A vulnerability in Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Software could allow an unauthenticated, local attacker to gain unauthorized access to an affected device.\n\nThe vulnerability is due to the existence of default credentials within the default configuration of an affected device. An attacker who has access to an affected device could log in with elevated privileges. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to take complete control of the device.\n\nThis vulnerability affects Cisco devices that are running Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Software releases 16.11 and earlier.\n\n"
