      "oldValue": "An elevation of privilege exists in Windows Audio Service, aka 'Windows Audio Service Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability'. This CVE ID is unique from CVE-2019-1021, CVE-2019-1022, CVE-2019-1026, CVE-2019-1027, CVE-2019-1028.",
      "newValue": "An elevation of privilege exists in Windows Audio Service. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could run arbitrary code with elevated privileges.\nTo exploit the vulnerability, an attacker could run a specially crafted application that could exploit the vulnerability. This vulnerability by itself does not allow arbitrary code to be run.  However, this vulnerability could be used in conjunction with one or more vulnerabilities (e.g. a remote code execution vulnerability and another elevation of privilege) that could take advantage of the elevated privileges when running.\nThe update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how the Windows Audio Service handles processes these requests."
