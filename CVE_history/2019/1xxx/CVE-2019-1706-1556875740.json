      "oldValue": "A vulnerability in the software cryptography module of the Cisco Adaptive Security Virtual Appliance (ASAv) and Firepower 2100 Series running Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an unexpected reload of the device that results in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to a logic error with how the software cryptography module handles IPsec sessions.  An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by creating and sending traffic in a high number of IPsec sessions through the targeted device. A successful exploit could cause the device to reload and result in a DoS condition.",
