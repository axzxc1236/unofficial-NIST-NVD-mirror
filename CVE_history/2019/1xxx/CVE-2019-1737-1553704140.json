      "oldValue": "A vulnerability in the processing of IP Service Level Agreement (SLA) packets by Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an interface wedge and an eventual denial of service (DoS) condition on the affected device.  The vulnerability is due to improper socket resources handling in the IP SLA responder application code. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted IP SLA packets to an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause an interface to become wedged, resulting in an eventual denial of service (DoS) condition on the affected device.",
