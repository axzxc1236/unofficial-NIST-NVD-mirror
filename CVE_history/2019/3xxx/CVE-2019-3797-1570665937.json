Derived queries using any of the predicates ?startingWith?, ?endingWith? or ?containing? could return more results than anticipated when a maliciously crafted query parameter value is supplied. Also, LIKE expressions in manually defined queries could return unexpected results if the parameter values bound did not have escaped reserved characters properly.",
