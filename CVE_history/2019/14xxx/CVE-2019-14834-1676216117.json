      "oldValue": "A flaw was found in the Dnsmasq application where a remote attacker can trigger a memory leak by sending specially crafted DHCP responses to the server. A successful attack is dependent on a specific configuration regarding the domain name set into the dnsmasq.conf file. Over time, the memory leak may cause the process to run out of memory and terminate, causing a denial of service.",
