A heap-based buffer overflow flaw, in SDL while copying an existing surface into a new optimized one, due to a lack of validation while loading a BMP image, is possible. An application that uses SDL to parse untrusted input files may be vulnerable to this flaw, which could allow an attacker to make the application crash or execute code.",
