      "oldValue": "A vulnerability was found in marvell wifi chip driver in Linux kernel. There is a heap-based buffer overflow in lbs_ibss_join_existing function in drivers/net/wireless/marvell/libertas/cfg.c allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. When STA connects to AP, lbs_ibss_join_existing function will be called for STA.",

A remote attacker could cause a denial of service (system crash) or, possibly execute arbitrary code, when the lbs_ibss_join_existing function is called after a STA connects to an AP."
