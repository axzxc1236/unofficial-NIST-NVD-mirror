      "type": "Description",
      "oldValue": "There is heap-based buffer overflow in kernel, all versions up to, excluding 5.3, in the marvell wifi chip driver in Linux kernel, that allows local users to cause a denial of service(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
      "newValue": "A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's Marvell WiFi chip driver. Where, while parsing vendor-specific informational attributes, an attacker on the same WiFi physical network segment could cause a system crash, resulting in a denial of service, or potentially execute arbitrary code. This flaw affects the network interface at the most basic level meaning the attacker only needs to affiliate with the same network device as the vulnerable system to create an attack path."
