A privileged guest user able to pass descriptors with invalid length to the host when migration is underway, could use this flaw to increase their privileges on the host. In the worst case (and likely most common virtualization) scenario this flaw affects KVM/qemu hypervisor enabled hosts running Linux guests.",
