      "type": "Description",
      "oldValue": "In Libreswan 3.27 an assertion failure can lead to a pluto IKE daemon restart. An attacker can trigger a NULL pointer dereference by sending two IKEv2 packets (init_IKE and delete_IKE) in 3des_cbc mode to a Libreswan server. This affects send_v2N_spi_response_from_state in programs/pluto/ikev2_send.c when built with Network Security Services (NSS).",
      "newValue": "In Libreswan 3.27 an assertion failure can lead to a pluto IKE daemon restart. An attacker can trigger a NULL pointer dereference by initiating an IKEv2 IKE_SA_INIT exchange, followed by a bogus INFORMATIONAL exchange instead of the normallly expected IKE_AUTH exchange. This affects send_v2N_spi_response_from_state() in programs/pluto/ikev2_send.c that will then trigger a NULL pointer dereference leading to a restart of libreswan."
