      "newValue": "** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in sunxi_divs_clk_setup in drivers/clk/sunxi/clk-sunxi.c in the Linux kernel through 5.1.5. There is an unchecked kstrndup of derived_name, which might allow an attacker to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash). NOTE: This id is disputed as not being an issue because ?The memory allocation that was not checked is part of a code that only runs at boot time, before user processes are started. Therefore, there is no possibility for an unprivileged user to control it, and no denial of service.?."
