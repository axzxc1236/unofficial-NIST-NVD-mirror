It uses kstrndup instead of kmemdup_nul, which allows attackers to have an unspecified impact via unknown vectors. NOTE: The vendor disputes this issues as not being a vulnerability because switching to kmemdup_nul() would only fix a security issue if the source string wasn't NUL-terminated, which is not the case.",
