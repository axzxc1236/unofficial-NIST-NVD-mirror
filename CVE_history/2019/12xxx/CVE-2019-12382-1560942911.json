There is an unchecked kstrdup of fwstr, which might allow an attacker to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash). NOTE: The vendor disputes this issues as not being a vulnerability because kstrdup() returning NULL is handled sufficiently and there is no chance for a NULL pointer dereference."
