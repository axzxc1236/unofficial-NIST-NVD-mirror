      "oldValue": "WordPress before 5.3.1 allowed an attacker to create a cross-site scripting attack (XSS) in well crafted links, because of an insufficient protection mechanism in wp_targeted_link_rel in wp-includes/formatting.php.",
      "newValue": "In wp-includes/formatting.php in WordPress 3.7 to 5.3.0, the function wp_targeted_link_rel() can be used in a particular way to result in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. This has been patched in WordPress 5.3.1, along with all the previous WordPress versions from 3.7 to 5.3 via a minor release."
