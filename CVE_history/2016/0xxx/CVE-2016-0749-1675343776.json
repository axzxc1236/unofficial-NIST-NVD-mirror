      "type": "Description",
      "oldValue": "The smartcard interaction in SPICE allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (QEMU-KVM process crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via vectors related to connecting to a guest VM, which triggers a heap-based buffer overflow.",
      "newValue": "A memory allocation flaw, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow, was found in spice's smartcard interaction, which runs under the QEMU-KVM context on the host. A user connecting to a guest VM using spice could potentially use this flaw to crash the QEMU-KVM process or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the host's QEMU-KVM process."
