      "oldValue": "The join_session_keyring function in security/keys/process_keys.c in the Linux kernel before 4.4.1 mishandles object references in a certain error case, which allows local users to gain privileges or cause a denial of service (integer overflow and use-after-free) via crafted keyctl commands.",
      "newValue": "A use-after-free flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's key management subsystem handled keyring object reference counting in certain error path of the join_session_keyring() function. A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to escalate their privileges on the system."
