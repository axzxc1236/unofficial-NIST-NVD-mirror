      "oldValue": "OpenStack Image Service (Glance) before 2015.1.3 (kilo) and 11.0.x before 11.0.2 (liberty), when show_multiple_locations is enabled, allow remote authenticated users to change image status and upload new image data by removing the last location of an image.",
      "newValue": "An authorization vulnerability in OpenStack Image service was discovered, which allowed image-status manipulation using locations. By removing the last location of an image, an authenticated user could change the status from 'active' to 'queue'. A malicious tenant could exploit this flaw to silently replace owned image data, regardless of its original creator or visibility settings. Only environments with show_multiple_locations set to true (not default) were affected."
