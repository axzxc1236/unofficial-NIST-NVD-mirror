      "type": "Description",
      "oldValue": "An out-of-bounds heap memory access leading to a Denial of Service, heap disclosure, or further impact was found in setsockopt(). The function call is normally restricted to root, however some processes with cap_sys_admin may also be able to trigger this flaw in privileged container environments.",
      "newValue": "The IPT_SO_SET_REPLACE setsockopt implementation in the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel before 4.6 allows local users to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read) or possibly obtain sensitive information from kernel heap memory by leveraging in-container root access to provide a crafted offset value that leads to crossing a ruleset blob boundary."
