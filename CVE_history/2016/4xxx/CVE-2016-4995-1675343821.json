      "oldValue": "Foreman before 1.11.4 and 1.12.x before 1.12.1 does not properly restrict access to preview provisioning templates, which allows remote authenticated users with permission to view some hosts to obtain sensitive host configuration information via a URL with a hostname.",
      "newValue": "A flaw was found in foreman's handling of template previews. An attacker with permissions to preview host templates can access the template preview for any host if they are able to guess the host name, disclosing potentially sensitive information."
