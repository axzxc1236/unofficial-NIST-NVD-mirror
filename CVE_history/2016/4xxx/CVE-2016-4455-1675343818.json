      "type": "Description",
      "oldValue": "The Subscription Manager package (aka subscription-manager) before 1.17.7-1 for Candlepin uses weak permissions (755) for subscription-manager cache directories, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information by reading files in the directories.",
      "newValue": "It was found that subscription-manager set weak permissions on files in /var/lib/rhsm/, causing an information disclosure. A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to access sensitive data that could potentially be used in a social engineering attack."
