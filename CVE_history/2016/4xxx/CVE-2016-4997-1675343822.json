      "type": "Description",
      "oldValue": "The compat IPT_SO_SET_REPLACE and IP6T_SO_SET_REPLACE setsockopt implementations in the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel before 4.6.3 allow local users to gain privileges or cause a denial of service (memory corruption) by leveraging in-container root access to provide a crafted offset value that triggers an unintended decrement.",
      "newValue": "A flaw was discovered in processing setsockopt for 32 bit processes on 64 bit systems. This flaw will allow attackers to alter arbitrary kernel memory when unloading a kernel module. This action is usually restricted to root-privileged users but can also be leveraged if the kernel is compiled with CONFIG_USER_NS and CONFIG_NET_NS and the user is granted elevated privileges."
