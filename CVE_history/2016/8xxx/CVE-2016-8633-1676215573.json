      "type": "Description",
      "oldValue": "A buffer overflow vulnerability due to a lack of input filtering of incoming fragmented datagrams was found in the IP-over-1394 driver [firewire-net] in a fragment handling code in the Linux kernel. The vulnerability exists since firewire supported IPv4, i.e. since version 2.6.31 (year 2009) till version v4.9-rc4. A maliciously formed fragment with a respectively large datagram offset would cause a memcpy() past the datagram buffer, which would cause a system panic or possible arbitrary code execution. The flaw requires [firewire-net] module to be loaded and is remotely exploitable from connected firewire devices, but not over a local network.",
      "newValue": "drivers/firewire/net.c in the Linux kernel before 4.8.7, in certain unusual hardware configurations, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via crafted fragmented packets."
