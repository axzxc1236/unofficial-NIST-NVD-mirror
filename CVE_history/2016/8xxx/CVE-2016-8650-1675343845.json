      "oldValue": "The mpi_powm function in lib/mpi/mpi-pow.c in the Linux kernel through 4.8.11 does not ensure that memory is allocated for limb data, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (stack memory corruption and panic) via an add_key system call for an RSA key with a zero exponent.",
      "newValue": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel key management subsystem in which a local attacker could crash the kernel or corrupt the stack and additional memory (denial of service) by supplying a specially crafted RSA key. This flaw panics the machine during the verification of the RSA key."
