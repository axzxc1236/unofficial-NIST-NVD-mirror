      "type": "Description",
      "oldValue": "The (1) fw_cfg_write and (2) fw_cfg_read functions in hw/nvram/fw_cfg.c in QEMU before 2.4, when built with the Firmware Configuration device emulation support, allow guest OS users with the CAP_SYS_RAWIO privilege to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read or write access and process crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via an invalid current entry value in a firmware configuration.",
      "newValue": "An out-of-bounds read/write flaw was discovered in the way QEMU's Firmware Configuration device emulation processed certain firmware configurations. A privileged (CAP_SYS_RAWIO) guest user could use this flaw to crash the QEMU process instance or, potentially, execute arbitrary code on the host with privileges of the QEMU process."
