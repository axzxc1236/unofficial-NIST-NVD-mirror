      "oldValue": "An infinite loop flaw was found in the way QEMU's e1000 NIC emulation implementation processed data using transmit or receive descriptors under certain conditions. A privileged user inside a guest could use this flaw to crash the QEMU instance.",
      "newValue": "QEMU (aka Quick Emulator) built with the e1000 NIC emulation support is vulnerable to an infinite loop issue. It could occur while processing data via transmit or receive descriptors, provided the initial receive/transmit descriptor head (TDH/RDH) is set outside the allocated descriptor buffer. A privileged user inside guest could use this flaw to crash the QEMU instance resulting in DoS."
