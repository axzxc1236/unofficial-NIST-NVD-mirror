      "action": "Changed",
      "type": "Description",
      "oldValue": "PHP through 7.0.8 does not attempt to address RFC 3875 section 4.1.18 namespace conflicts and therefore does not protect applications from the presence of untrusted client data in the HTTP_PROXY environment variable, which might allow remote attackers to redirect an application's outbound HTTP traffic to an arbitrary proxy server via a crafted Proxy header in an HTTP request, as demonstrated by (1) an application that makes a getenv('HTTP_PROXY') call or (2) a CGI configuration of PHP, aka an \"httpoxy\" issue.",
      "newValue": "It was discovered that PHP did not properly protect against the HTTP_PROXY variable name clash. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to redirect HTTP requests performed by a PHP script to an attacker-controlled proxy via a malicious HTTP request."
