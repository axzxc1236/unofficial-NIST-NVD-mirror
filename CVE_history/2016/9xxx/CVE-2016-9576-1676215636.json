      "newValue": "The blk_rq_map_user_iov function in block/blk-map.c in the Linux kernel before 4.8.14 does not properly restrict the type of iterator, which allows local users to read or write to arbitrary kernel memory locations or cause a denial of service (use-after-free) by leveraging access to a /dev/sg device."
