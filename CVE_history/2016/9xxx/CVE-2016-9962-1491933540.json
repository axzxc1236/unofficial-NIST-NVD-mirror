      "type": "Description",
      "oldValue": "Race condition in Docker Engine before 1.12.6 might allow local root users in a container to gain privileges by using ptrace to access file-descriptors of a process launched or moved into the container from another namespace, aka an \"on-entry vulnerability.\"",
      "newValue": "RunC allowed additional container processes via 'runc exec' to be ptraced by the pid 1 of the container.  This allows the main processes of the container, if running as root, to gain access to file-descriptors of these new processes during the initialization and can lead to container escapes or modification of runC state before the process is fully placed inside the container."
