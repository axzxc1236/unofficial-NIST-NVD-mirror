      "type": "Description",
      "oldValue": "A memory-leak flaw was found in the Quick Emulator(QEMU) built with USB xHCI controller emulation support. The flaw could occur while doing a USB-device unplug operation. Unplugging the device repeatedly resulted in leaking host memory, which affected other services on the host. A privileged user inside the guest could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service on the host or potentially crash the host's QEMU process instance.",
      "newValue": "Memory leak in the usb_xhci_exit function in hw/usb/hcd-xhci.c in QEMU (aka Quick Emulator), when the xhci uses msix, allows local guest OS administrators to cause a denial of service (memory consumption and possibly QEMU process crash) by repeatedly unplugging a USB device."
