      "oldValue": "The (1) xmlParserEntityCheck and (2) xmlParseAttValueComplex functions in parser.c in libxml2 2.9.3 do not properly keep track of the recursion depth, which allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (stack consumption and application crash) via a crafted XML document containing a large number of nested entity references.",
      "newValue": "Missing incrementation of recursion depth counter were found in the xmlParserEntityCheck() and xmlParseAttValueComplex() functions used for parsing XML data. An attacker could launch a Denial of Service attack by passing specially crafted XML data to an application, forcing it to crash due to stack exhaustion."
