An attacker on a non-local network could use this flaw to advertise a node as a router, allowing them to perform man-in-the-middle attacks on a connecting client, or disrupt the network connectivity of that client.",
      "newValue": "libndp before 1.6, as used in NetworkManager, does not properly validate the origin of Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP) messages, which allows remote attackers to conduct man-in-the-middle attacks or cause a denial of service (network connectivity disruption) by advertising a node as a router from a non-local network."
