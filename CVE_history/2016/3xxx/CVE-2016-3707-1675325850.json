      "oldValue": "The icmp_check_sysrq function in net/ipv4/icmp.c in the kernel.org projects/rt patches for the Linux kernel, as used in the kernel-rt package before 3.10.0-327.22.1 in Red Hat Enterprise Linux for Real Time 7 and other products, allows remote attackers to execute SysRq commands via crafted ICMP Echo Request packets, as demonstrated by a brute-force attack to discover a cookie, or an attack that occurs after reading the local icmp_echo_sysrq file.",
      "newValue": "A flaw was found in the way the realtime kernel processed specially crafted ICMP echo requests. A remote attacker could use this flaw to trigger a sysrql function based on values in the ICMP packet, allowing them to remotely restart the system. Note that this feature is not enabled by default and requires elevated privileges to be configured."
