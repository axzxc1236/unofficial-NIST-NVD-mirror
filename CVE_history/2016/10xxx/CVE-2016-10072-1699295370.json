This could potentially allow an authorized but non-privileged local user to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges on the system. To properly exploit this vulnerability, the local attacker must insert an executable file called wampmanager.exe or unins000.exe and replace the original files. The next time one of these programs is launched by a more privileged user, malicious code chosen by the local attacker will run. NOTE: the vendor disputes the relevance of this report, taking the position that a configuration in which \"'someone' (an attacker) is able to replace files on a PC\" is not \"the fault of WampServer.\"",
