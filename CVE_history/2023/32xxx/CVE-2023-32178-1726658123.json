This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on affected installations of VIPRE Antivirus Plus. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the TelFileTransfer method. By creating a symbolic link, an attacker can abuse the method to delete arbitrary files. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of SYSTEM. Was ZDI-CAN-19396.",
