      "type": "Description",
      "oldValue": "An issue was discovered in Paessler PRTG Network Monitor 23.2.83.1760. Due to command-line parameter injection and an undocumented debug feature flag, an attacker can utilize the DICOM sensor to write arbitrary data to the disk. This can be utilized to write a custom EXE(.bat) sensor, that will then run. This primitive gives remote code execution.",
      "newValue": "A command injection was identified in PRTG 23.2.84.1566 and earlier versions in the Dicom C-ECHO sensor where an authenticated user with write permissions could abuse the debug option to write new files that could potentially get executed by the EXE/Script sensor. The severity of this vulnerability is high and received a score of 7.2 CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"
