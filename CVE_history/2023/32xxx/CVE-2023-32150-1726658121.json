This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of D-Link DIR-2640 routers. Although authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability, the existing authentication mechanism can be bypassed.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the handling of the PrefixLen parameter provided to the HNAP1 endpoint. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied string before using it to execute a system call. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of root. Was ZDI-CAN-19547.",
