This vulnerability allows remote attackers to create a denial-of-service condition on affected installations of Unified Automation UaGateway. Authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability when the product is in its default configuration.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the implementation of the AddServer method. By specifying crafted arguments, an attacker can cause invalid characters to be inserted into an XML configuration file. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to create a persistent denial-of-service condition on the system. . Was ZDI-CAN-20576.",
