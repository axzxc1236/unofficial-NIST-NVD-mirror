      "newValue": "An issue was discovered in SchedMD Slurm 23.02.x and 23.11.x. There is Incorrect Access Control because of a slurmd Message Integrity Bypass. An attacker can reuse root-level authentication tokens during interaction with the slurmd process. This bypasses the RPC message hashes that protect against undesired MUNGE credential reuse. The fixed versions are 23.02.7 and 23.11.1."
