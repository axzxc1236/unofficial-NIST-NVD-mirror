In the worse case scenario, remote code execution could be achieved.\n\nApplications are only affected if they are using the  ChrootOS https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/go-git/go-billy/v5/osfs#ChrootOS , which is the default when using \"Plain\" versions of Open and Clone funcs (e.g. PlainClone). Applications using  BoundOS https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/go-git/go-billy/v5/osfs#BoundOS  or in-memory filesystems are not affected by this issue.\nThis is a go-git implementation issue and does not affect the upstream git cli.\n\n\n"
