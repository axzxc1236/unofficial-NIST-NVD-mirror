The expose_config option is False by default. It is recommended to upgrade to a version that is not affected if you set expose_config to non-sensitive-only configuration. This is a different error than CVE-2023-45348 which allows authenticated user to retrieve individual configuration values in 2.7.* by specially crafting their request (solved in 2.7.2).\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 2.7.2, which fixes the issue and additionally fixes CVE-2023-45348.\n\n",
