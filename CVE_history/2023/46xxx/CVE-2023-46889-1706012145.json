      "newValue": "Meross MSH30Q 4.5.23 is vulnerable to Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information. During the device setup phase, the MSH30Q creates an unprotected Wi-Fi access point. In this phase, MSH30Q needs to connect to the Internet through a Wi-Fi router. This is why MSH30Q asks for the Wi-Fi network name (SSID) and the Wi-Fi network password. When the user enters the password, the transmission of the Wi-Fi password and name between the MSH30Q and mobile application is observed in the Wi-Fi network. Although the Wi-Fi password is encrypted, a part of the decryption algorithm is public so we complemented the missing parts to decrypt it."
