Custom MyCode (BBCode) for the visual editor (_SCEditor_) doesn't escape input properly when rendering HTML, resulting in a DOM-based XSS vulnerability. This weakness can be exploited by pointing a victim to a page where the visual editor is active (e.g. as a post or Private Message) and operates on a maliciously crafted MyCode message. This may occur on pages where message content is pre-filled using a GET/POST parameter, or on reply pages where a previously saved malicious message is quoted. The impact is be mitigated when: 1. the visual editor is disabled globally (_Admin CP ? Configuration ? Settings ? Clickable Smilies and BB Code: [Clickable MyCode Editor](https://github.com/mybb/mybb/blob/mybb_1836/install/resources/settings.xml#L2087-L2094)_ is set to _Off_), or 2. the visual editor is disabled for individual user accounts (_User CP ? Your Profile ? Edit Options_: _Show the MyCode formatting options on the posting pages_ checkbox is not checked). MyBB 1.8.37 resolves this issue with the commit `6dcaf0b4d`. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may mitigate the impact without upgrading MyBB by changing the following setting (_Admin CP ? Configuration ?
