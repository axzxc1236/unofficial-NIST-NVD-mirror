This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of LG Simple Editor. Although authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability, the existing authentication mechanism can be bypassed.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the getImageByFilename method in the PlayerController class. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied path prior to using it in file operations. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to disclose information in the context of SYSTEM. Was ZDI-CAN-20014.",
