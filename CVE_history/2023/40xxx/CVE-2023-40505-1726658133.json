This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of LG Simple Editor. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the createThumbnailByMovie method. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied string before using it to execute a system call. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of SYSTEM. Was ZDI-CAN-19978.",
