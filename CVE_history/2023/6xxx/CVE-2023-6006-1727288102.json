      "oldValue": "This vulnerability potentially allows local attackers to escalate privileges on affected installations of PaperCut NG. An attacker must be able to write into the local C Drive. In addition, the attacker must have admin privileges to enable Print Archiving or encounter a misconfigured system. This vulnerability does not apply to PaperCut NG installs that have Print Archiving enabled and configured as per the recommended set up procedure. This specific flaw exists within the pc-pdl-to-image process. The process loads an executable from an unsecured location. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of SYSTEM",
