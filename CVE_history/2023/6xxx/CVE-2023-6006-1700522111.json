An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the pc-pdl-to-image process. The process loads an executable from an unsecured location. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of SYSTEM.",

In addition, the attacker must have admin privileges to enable Print Archiving or encounter a misconfigured system. This vulnerability does not apply to PaperCut NG installs that have Print Archiving enabled and configured as per the recommended set up procedure.
