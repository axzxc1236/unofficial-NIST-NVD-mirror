      "newValue": "wolfSSL SP Math All RSA implementation is vulnerable to the Marvin Attack, new variation of a timing Bleichenbacher style attack, when built with the following options to configure:\n\n--enable-all CFLAGS=\"-DWOLFSSL_STATIC_RSA\"\n\nThe define “WOLFSSL_STATIC_RSA” enables static RSA cipher suites, which is not recommended, and has been disabled by default since wolfSSL 3.6.6.  Therefore the default build since 3.6.6, even with \"--enable-all\", is not vulnerable to the Marvin Attack. The vulnerability is specific to static RSA cipher suites, and expected to be padding-independent.\n\nThe vulnerability allows an attacker to decrypt ciphertexts and forge signatures after probing with a large number of test observations. However the server’s private key is not exposed.\n"
