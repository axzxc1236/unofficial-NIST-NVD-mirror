      "type": "Description",
      "newValue": "A stack based buffer overflow was found in the virtio-net device of QEMU. This issue occurs when flushing TX in the virtio_net_flush_tx function if guest features VIRTIO_NET_F_HASH_REPORT, VIRTIO_F_VERSION_1 and VIRTIO_NET_F_MRG_RXBUF are enabled. This could allow a malicious user to overwrite local variables allocated on the stack. Specifically, the `out_sg` variable could be used to read a part of process memory and send it to the wire, causing an information leak."
