      "type": "Description",
      "newValue": "The SVG Support plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the SVG upload feature in all versions up to, and including, 2.5.5 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping, even when the 'Sanitize SVG while uploading' feature is enabled. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with author-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. Note that successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires the administrator to allow author-level users to upload SVG files."
