      "oldValue": "Splunk SOAR versions lower than 6.1.0 are indirectly affected by a potential vulnerability accessed through the user’s terminal. A third party can send Splunk SOAR a maliciously crafted web request containing special ANSI characters to cause log file poisoning. When a terminal user attempts to view the poisoned logs, this can tamper with the terminal and cause possible malicious code execution from the terminal user’s action.",

A third party can send Splunk SOAR a maliciously crafted web request containing special ANSI characters to cause log file poisoning.
