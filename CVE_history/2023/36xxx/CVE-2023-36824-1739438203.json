In Redit 7.0 prior to 7.0.12, extracting key names from a command and a list of arguments may, in some cases, trigger a heap overflow and result in reading random heap memory, heap corruption and potentially remote code execution. Several scenarios that may lead to authenticated users executing a specially crafted `COMMAND GETKEYS` or `COMMAND GETKEYSANDFLAGS`and authenticated users who were set with ACL rules that match key names, executing a specially crafted command that refers to a variadic list of key names. The vulnerability is patched in Redis 7.0.12.\n\n",
