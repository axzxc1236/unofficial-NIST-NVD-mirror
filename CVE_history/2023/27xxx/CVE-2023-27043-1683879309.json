      "type": "Description",
      "oldValue": "The e-mail module of Python 0 - 2.7.18, 3.x - 3.11 incorrectly parses e-mail addresses which contain a special character. This vulnerability allows attackers to send messages from e-ail addresses that would otherwise be rejected.",
      "newValue": "The email module of Python through 3.11.3 incorrectly parses e-mail addresses that contain a special character. The wrong portion of an RFC2822 header is identified as the value of the addr-spec. In some applications, an attacker can bypass a protection mechanism in which application access is granted only after verifying receipt of e-mail to a specific domain (e.g., only @company.example.com addresses may be used for signup). This occurs in email/_parseaddr.py in recent versions of Python."
