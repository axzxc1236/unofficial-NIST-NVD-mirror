This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of NETGEAR RAX30. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the soap_serverd binary. When parsing the request headers, the process does not properly validate the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to bypass authentication on the system. Was ZDI-CAN-19840."
