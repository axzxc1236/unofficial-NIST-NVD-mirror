This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of TP-Link Archer AX21 routers. Authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the handling of command 0x422 provided to the tmpServer service. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer.
