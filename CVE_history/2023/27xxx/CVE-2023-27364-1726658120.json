This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Foxit PDF Editor. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the parsing of XLS files. The issue results from the lack of proper restrictions on macro-enabled documents. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.
