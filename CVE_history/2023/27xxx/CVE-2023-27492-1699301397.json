Prior to versions 1.26.0, 1.25.3, 1.24.4, 1.23.6, and 1.22.9, the Lua filter is vulnerable to denial of service. Attackers can send large request bodies for routes that have Lua filter enabled and trigger crashes. As of versions versions 1.26.0, 1.25.3, 1.24.4, 1.23.6, and 1.22.9, Envoy no longer invokes the Lua coroutine if the filter has been reset. As a workaround for those whose Lua filter is buffering all requests/ responses, mitigate by using the buffer filter to avoid triggering the local reply in the Lua filter.",
