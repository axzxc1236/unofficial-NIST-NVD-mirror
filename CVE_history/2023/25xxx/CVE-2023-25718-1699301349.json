It is plausible that the end user may allow the download and execution of this file to proceed. There are ConnectWise Control configuration options that add mitigations. NOTE: this may overlap CVE-2023-25719. NOTE: the vendor's position is that this purported vulnerability represents a \"fundamental lack of understanding of Authenticode code signing behavior.\"",
