Due to a missing permissions check, an attacker with an authenticated Apiman Manager account may be able to gain access to API keys they do not have permission for if they correctly guess the URL, which includes Organisation ID, Client ID, and Client Version of the targeted non-permitted resource. While not trivial to exploit, it could be achieved by brute-forcing or guessing common names. Access to the non-permitted API Keys could allow use of other users' resources without their permission (depending on the specifics of configuration, such as whether an API key is the only form of security). Apiman 3.1.0.Final resolved this issue. Users are advised to upgrade. The only known workaround is to restrict account access.",
