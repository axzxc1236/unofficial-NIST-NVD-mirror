      "newValue": "An issue was discovered in the captive portal in OpenNDS before version 10.1.3. get_query in http_microhttpd.c does not validate the length of the query string of GET requests. This leads to a stack-based buffer overflow in versions 9.x and earlier, and to a heap-based buffer overflow in versions 10.x and later. Attackers may exploit the issue to crash OpenNDS (Denial-of-Service condition) or to inject and execute arbitrary bytecode (Remote Code Execution)."
