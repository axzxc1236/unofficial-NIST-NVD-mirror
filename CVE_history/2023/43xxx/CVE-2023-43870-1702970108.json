A potential hacker could access the installer batch file or reverse engineer the source code to gain access to the root certificate password. Using the root certificate and password they could then create their own certificates to emulate another site. Then by establishing a proxy service to emulate the site they could monitor traffic passed between the end user and the site allowing access to the data content."
