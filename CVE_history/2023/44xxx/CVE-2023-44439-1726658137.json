This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Ashlar-Vellum Xenon. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the parsing of various file types. The process loads a library from an unsecured location. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-21679.",
