An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a series of unauthenticated requests to the reverse proxy. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause all current traffic and subsequent requests to the reverse proxy through a load balancer to be dropped, resulting in a DoS condition.\r ",
