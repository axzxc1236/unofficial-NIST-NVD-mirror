      "newValue": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Prime Collaboration Deployment could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting attack against a user of the interface.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.\r\nCisco plans to release software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability."
