Prior to version 2.1.2, it was possible to submit the registration form with the essential fields, such as the username and password, left intentionally blank. This inadvertent omission allowed for a bypass of the mandatory field requirements (e.g. surname, company name) established by the system. Version 2.1.2 fixes this issue.\n"
