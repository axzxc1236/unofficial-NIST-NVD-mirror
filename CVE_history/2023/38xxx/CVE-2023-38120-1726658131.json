This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Adtran SR400ac routers. Although authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability, the existing authentication mechanism can be bypassed.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the ping command, which is available over JSON-RPC. A crafted host parameter can trigger execution of a system call composed from a user-supplied string. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of root. Was ZDI-CAN-20525.",
