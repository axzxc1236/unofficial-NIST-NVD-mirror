      "oldValue": "`import-in-the-middle` is a module loading interceptor specifically for ESM modules. Prior to version 1.4.2, the `import-in-the-middle` loader works by generating a wrapper module on the fly. The wrapper uses the module specifier to load the original module and add some wrapping code. It allows for remote code execution in cases where an application passes user-supplied input directly to an `import()` function. This vulnerability has been patched in `import-in-the-middle` version 1.4.2. Some workarounds are available. Do not pass any user-supplied input to `import()`. Instead, verify it against a set of allowed values. If using `import-in-the-middle` and support for EcmaScript Modules is not needed, ensure that certain options are set, either via command-line or the `NODE_OPTIONS` environment variable.",
