      "oldValue": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nusb: dwc3: don't reset device side if dwc3 was configured as host-only\n\nCommit c4a5153e87fd (\"usb: dwc3: core: Power-off core/PHYs on\nsystem_suspend in host mode\") replaces check for HOST only dr_mode with\ncurrent_dr_role. But during booting, the current_dr_role isn't\ninitialized, thus the device side reset is always issued even if dwc3\nwas configured as host-only. What's more, on some platforms with host\nonly dwc3, aways issuing device side reset by accessing device register\nblock can cause kernel panic.",
