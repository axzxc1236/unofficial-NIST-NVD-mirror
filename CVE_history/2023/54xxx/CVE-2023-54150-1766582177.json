      "newValue": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/amd: Fix an out of bounds error in BIOS parser\n\nThe array is hardcoded to 8 in atomfirmware.h, but firmware provides\na bigger one sometimes. Deferencing the larger array causes an out\nof bounds error.\n\ncommit 4fc1ba4aa589 (\"drm/amd/display: fix array index out of bound error\nin bios parser\") fixed some of this, but there are two other cases\nnot covered by it.  Fix those as well."
