      "newValue": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nALSA: usb-audio: Fix potential memory leaks at error path for UMP open\n\nThe allocation and initialization errors at alloc_midi_urbs() that is\ncalled at MIDI 2.0 / UMP device are supposed to be handled at the\ncaller side by invoking free_midi_urbs().  However, free_midi_urbs()\nloops only for ep->num_urbs entries, and since ep->num_entries wasn't\nupdated yet at the allocation / init error in alloc_midi_urbs(), this\nentry won't be released.\n\nThe intention of free_midi_urbs() is to release the whole elements, so\nchange the loop size to NUM_URBS to scan over all elements for fixing\nthe missed releases.\n\nAlso, the call of free_midi_urbs() is missing at\nsnd_usb_midi_v2_open().  Although it'll be released later at\nreopen/close or disconnection, it's better to release immediately at\nthe error path."
