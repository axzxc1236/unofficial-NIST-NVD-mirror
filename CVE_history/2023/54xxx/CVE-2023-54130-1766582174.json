      "newValue": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nhfs/hfsplus: avoid WARN_ON() for sanity check, use proper error handling\n\nCommit 55d1cbbbb29e (\"hfs/hfsplus: use WARN_ON for sanity check\") fixed\na build warning by turning a comment into a WARN_ON(), but it turns out\nthat syzbot then complains because it can trigger said warning with a\ncorrupted hfs image.\n\nThe warning actually does warn about a bad situation, but we are much\nbetter off just handling it as the error it is.  So rather than warn\nabout us doing bad things, stop doing the bad things and return -EIO.\n\nWhile at it, also fix a memory leak that was introduced by an earlier\nfix for a similar syzbot warning situation, and add a check for one case\nthat historically wasn't handled at all (ie neither comment nor\nsubsequent WARN_ON)."
