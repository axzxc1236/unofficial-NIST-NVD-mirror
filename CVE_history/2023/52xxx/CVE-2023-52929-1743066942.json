      "newValue": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnvmem: core: fix cleanup after dev_set_name()\n\nIf dev_set_name() fails, we leak nvmem->wp_gpio as the cleanup does not\nput this. While a minimal fix for this would be to add the gpiod_put()\ncall, we can do better if we split device_register(), and use the\ntested nvmem_release() cleanup code by initialising the device early,\nand putting the device.\n\nThis results in a slightly larger fix, but results in clear code.\n\nNote: this patch depends on \"nvmem: core: initialise nvmem->id early\"\nand \"nvmem: core: remove nvmem_config wp_gpio\".\n\n[Srini: Fixed subject line and error code handing with wp_gpio while applying.]"
