      "newValue": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/i915: Fix potential context UAFs\n\ngem_context_register() makes the context visible to userspace, and which\npoint a separate thread can trigger the I915_GEM_CONTEXT_DESTROY ioctl.\nSo we need to ensure that nothing uses the ctx ptr after this.  And we\nneed to ensure that adding the ctx to the xarray is the *last* thing\nthat gem_context_register() does with the ctx pointer.\n\n[tursulin: Stable and fixes tags add/tidy.]\n(cherry picked from commit bed4b455cf5374e68879be56971c1da563bcd90c)"
