      "newValue": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nwifi: iwlwifi: mvm: Fix a memory corruption issue\n\nA few lines above, space is kzalloc()'ed for:\n\tsizeof(struct iwl_nvm_data) +\n\tsizeof(struct ieee80211_channel) +\n\tsizeof(struct ieee80211_rate)\n\n'mvm->nvm_data' is a 'struct iwl_nvm_data', so it is fine.\n\nAt the end of this structure, there is the 'channels' flex array.\nEach element is of type 'struct ieee80211_channel'.\nSo only 1 element is allocated in this array.\n\nWhen doing:\n  mvm->nvm_data->bands[0].channels = mvm->nvm_data->channels;\nWe point at the first element of the 'channels' flex array.\nSo this is fine.\n\nHowever, when doing:\n  mvm->nvm_data->bands[0].bitrates =\n\t\t\t(void *)((u8 *)mvm->nvm_data->channels + 1);\nbecause of the \"(u8 *)\" cast, we add only 1 to the address of the beginning\nof the flex array.\n\nIt is likely that we want point at the 'struct ieee80211_rate' allocated\njust after.\n\nRemove the spurious casting so that the pointer arithmetic works as\nexpected."
