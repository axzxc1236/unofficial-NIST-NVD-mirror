      "newValue": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nblock: ublk: extending queue_size to fix overflow\n\nWhen validating drafted SPDK ublk target, in a case that\nassigning large queue depth to multiqueue ublk device,\nublk target would run into a weird incorrect state. During\nrounds of review and debug, An overflow bug was found\nin ublk driver.\n\nIn ublk_cmd.h, UBLK_MAX_QUEUE_DEPTH is 4096 which means\neach ublk queue depth can be set as large as 4096. But\nwhen setting qd for a ublk device,\nsizeof(struct ublk_queue) + depth * sizeof(struct ublk_io)\nwill be larger than 65535 if qd is larger than 2728.\nThen queue_size is overflowed, and ublk_get_queue()\nreferences a wrong pointer position. The wrong content of\nublk_queue elements will lead to out-of-bounds memory\naccess.\n\nExtend queue_size in ublk_device as \"unsigned int\"."
