      "newValue": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nscsi: mpi3mr: Fix issues in mpi3mr_get_all_tgt_info()\n\nThe function mpi3mr_get_all_tgt_info() has four issues:\n\n1) It calculates valid entry length in alltgt_info assuming the header part\n   of the struct mpi3mr_device_map_info would equal to sizeof(u32).  The\n   correct size is sizeof(u64).\n\n2) When it calculates the valid entry length kern_entrylen, it excludes one\n   entry by subtracting 1 from num_devices.\n\n3) It copies num_device by calling memcpy(). Substitution is enough.\n\n4) It does not specify the calculated length to sg_copy_from_buffer().\n   Instead, it specifies the payload length which is larger than the\n   alltgt_info size. It causes \"BUG: KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds\".\n\nFix the issues by using the correct header size, removing the subtraction\nfrom num_devices, replacing the memcpy() with substitution and specifying\nthe correct length to sg_copy_from_buffer()."
