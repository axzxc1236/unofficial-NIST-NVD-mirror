Now in this\nsituation if driver removal procedure is initiated it would result\nin NULL pointer exception since unallocated wwan struct is dereferenced\ninside ipc_wwan_deinit().\n\nipc_imem_run_state_worker() to handle the called functions return value\nand to release the resource in failure case. It also reports the link\ndown event in failure cases. The user space application can handle this\nevent to do a device reset for restoring the device communication."
