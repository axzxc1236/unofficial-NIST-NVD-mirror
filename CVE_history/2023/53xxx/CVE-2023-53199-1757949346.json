      "newValue": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nwifi: ath9k: hif_usb: clean up skbs if ath9k_hif_usb_rx_stream() fails\n\nSyzkaller detected a memory leak of skbs in ath9k_hif_usb_rx_stream().\nWhile processing skbs in ath9k_hif_usb_rx_stream(), the already allocated\nskbs in skb_pool are not freed if ath9k_hif_usb_rx_stream() fails. If we\nhave an incorrect pkt_len or pkt_tag, the input skb is considered invalid\nand dropped. All the associated packets already in skb_pool should be\ndropped and freed. Added a comment describing this issue.\n\nThe patch also makes remain_skb NULL after being processed so that it\ncannot be referenced after potential free. The initialization of hif_dev\nfields which are associated with remain_skb (rx_remain_len,\nrx_transfer_len and rx_pad_len) is moved after a new remain_skb is\nallocated.\n\nFound by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with Syzkaller."
