However, DAMON sysfs interface and DAMON_RECLAIM are not\ninitializing it after calling damos_new_filter().  As a result, accessing\nuninitialized memory is possible.  Actually, adding multiple DAMOS filters\nvia DAMON sysfs interface caused NULL pointer dereferencing.  Initialize\nthe field just after the allocation from damos_new_filter()."
