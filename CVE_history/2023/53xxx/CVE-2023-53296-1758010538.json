      "newValue": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nsctp: check send stream number after wait_for_sndbuf\n\nThis patch fixes a corner case where the asoc out stream count may change\nafter wait_for_sndbuf.\n\nWhen the main thread in the client starts a connection, if its out stream\ncount is set to N while the in stream count in the server is set to N - 2,\nanother thread in the client keeps sending the msgs with stream number\nN - 1, and waits for sndbuf before processing INIT_ACK.\n\nHowever, after processing INIT_ACK, the out stream count in the client is\nshrunk to N - 2, the same to the in stream count in the server. The crash\noccurs when the thread waiting for sndbuf is awake and sends the msg in a\nnon-existing stream(N - 1), the call trace is as below:\n\n  KASAN: null-ptr-deref in range [0x0000000000000038-0x000000000000003f]\n  Call Trace:\n   <TASK>\n   sctp_cmd_send_msg net/sctp/sm_sideeffect.c:1114 [inline]\n   sctp_cmd_interpreter net/sctp/sm_sideeffect.c:1777 [inline]\n   sctp_side_effects net/sctp/sm_sideeffect.c:1199 [inline]\n   sctp_do_sm+0x197d/0x5310 net/sctp/sm_sideeffect.c:1170\n   sctp_primitive_SEND+0x9f/0xc0 net/sctp/primitive.c:163\n   sctp_sendmsg_to_asoc+0x10eb/0x1a30 net/sctp/socket.c:1868\n   sctp_sendmsg+0x8d4/0x1d90 net/sctp/socket.c:2026\n   inet_sendmsg+0x9d/0xe0 net/ipv4/af_inet.c:825\n   sock_sendmsg_nosec net/socket.c:722 [inline]\n   sock_sendmsg+0xde/0x190 net/socket.c:745\n\nThe fix is to add an unlikely check for the send stream number after the\nthread wakes up from the wait_for_sndbuf."
