And if a wakeup interrupt triggers afterwards,\ngserial_resume gets called, which will lead to accessing of\ngser->ioport and thus causing null pointer dereference.Add\na null pointer check to prevent this.\n\nAdded a static spinlock to prevent gser->ioport from becoming\nnull after the newly added check."
