      "newValue": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nDrivers: vmbus: Check for channel allocation before looking up relids\n\nrelid2channel() assumes vmbus channel array to be allocated when called.\nHowever, in cases such as kdump/kexec, not all relids will be reset by the host.\nWhen the second kernel boots and if the guest receives a vmbus interrupt during\nvmbus driver initialization before vmbus_connect() is called, before it finishes,\nor if it fails, the vmbus interrupt service routine is called which in turn calls\nrelid2channel() and can cause a null pointer dereference.\n\nPrint a warning and error out in relid2channel() for a channel id that's invalid\nin the second kernel."
