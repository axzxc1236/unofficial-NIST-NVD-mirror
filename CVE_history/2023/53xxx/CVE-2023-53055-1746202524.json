      "newValue": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nfscrypt: destroy keyring after security_sb_delete()\n\nfscrypt_destroy_keyring() must be called after all potentially-encrypted\ninodes were evicted; otherwise it cannot safely destroy the keyring.\nSince inodes that are in-use by the Landlock LSM don't get evicted until\nsecurity_sb_delete(), this means that fscrypt_destroy_keyring() must be\ncalled *after* security_sb_delete().\n\nThis fixes a WARN_ON followed by a NULL dereference, only possible if\nLandlock was being used on encrypted files."
