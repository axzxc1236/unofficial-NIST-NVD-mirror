      "type": "Description",
      "newValue": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\npwm: lpc32xx: Remove handling of PWM channels\n\nBecause LPC32xx PWM controllers have only a single output which is\nregistered as the only PWM device/channel per controller, it is known in\nadvance that pwm->hwpwm value is always 0. On basis of this fact\nsimplify the code by removing operations with pwm->hwpwm, there is no\ncontrols which require channel number as input.\n\nEven though I wasn't aware at the time when I forward ported that patch,\nthis fixes a null pointer dereference as lpc32xx->chip.pwms is NULL\nbefore devm_pwmchip_add() is called."
