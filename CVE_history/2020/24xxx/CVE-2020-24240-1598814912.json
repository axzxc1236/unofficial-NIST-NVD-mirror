      "type": "Description",
      "oldValue": "GNU Bison 3.7 has a use after free (UAF) vulnerability. A local attacker may execute bison with crafted input file containing a NULL byte, which could triggers UAF and thus cause system crash.",
      "newValue": "GNU Bison before 3.7.1 has a use-after-free in _obstack_free in lib/obstack.c (called from gram_lex) when a '\\0' byte is encountered. NOTE: there is a risk only if Bison is used with untrusted input, and the observed bug happens to cause unsafe behavior with a specific compiler/architecture. The bug report was intended to show that a crash may occur in Bison itself, not that a crash may occur in code that is generated by Bison."
