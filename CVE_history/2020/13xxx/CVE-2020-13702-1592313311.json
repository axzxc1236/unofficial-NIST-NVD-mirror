An attacker with access to Beacon or IoT networks can seamlessly track individual device movement via a Bluetooth LE discovery mechanism. NOTE: this is disputed because the specification states \"The advertiser address, Rolling Proximity Identifier, and Associated Encrypted Metadata shall be changed synchronously so that they cannot be linked\" and therefore the purported tracking actually cannot occur.",
