Have found a vulnerability in the victims spreadsheet software of choice.\n2. Control data that would potentially be exported through the `ImportExportController` by a theoretical victim.\n3. Convince the victim to export above data as a CSV and run it in vulnerable spreadsheet software while also bypassing any sanity checks by said software.\n\nIssue has been patched in Build 466 (v1.0.466).",
