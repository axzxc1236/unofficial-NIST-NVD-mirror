If you think this could have been exploited the linked advisory provides a SQL query to test.\nAs a workaround without upgrading, page edit permissions could be limited to only those that are trusted until you can upgrade although this will not address existing exploitation of this vulnerability. \n\nThe issue is fixed in BookStack version 0.30.4.
