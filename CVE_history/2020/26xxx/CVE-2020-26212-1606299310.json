      "oldValue": "GLPI stands for Gestionnaire Libre de Parc Informatique and it is a Free Asset and IT Management Software package, that provides ITIL Service Desk features, licenses tracking and software auditing.\n\nIn GLPI before version 9.5.3, any authenticated user has read-only permissions to the planning of every other user, even admin ones.\n\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\n1. Create a new planning with 'eduardo.mozart' user (from 'IT' group that belongs to 'Super-admin') into it's personal planning at 'Assistance' > 'Planning'.\n2. Copy the CalDAV url and use a CalDAV client (e.g. Thunderbird) to sync the planning with the provided URL.\n3. Inform the username and password from any valid user (e.g. 'camila' from 'Proativa' group).\n4. 'Camila' has read-only access to 'eduardo.mozart' personal planning.\n\nThe same behavior happens to any group. E.g. 'Camila' has access to 'IT' group planning, even if she doesn't belong to this group and has a 'Self-service' profile permission).\n\nThis issue is fixed in version 9.5.3.\n\nAs a workaround, one can remove the `caldav.php` file to block access to CalDAV server.",
