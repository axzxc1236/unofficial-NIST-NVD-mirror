In Jupyter Server before version 1.1.1, an open redirect vulnerability could cause the jupyter server to redirect the browser to a different malicious website.\n\nAll jupyter servers running without a base_url prefix are technically affected, however, these maliciously crafted links can only be reasonably made for known jupyter server hosts. A link to your jupyter server may *appear* safe, but ultimately redirect to a spoofed server on the public internet. This same vulnerability was patched in upstream notebook v5.7.8.\n\nThis is fixed in jupyter_server 1.1.1. If upgrade is not available, a workaround can be to run your server on a url prefix: \"jupyter server --ServerApp.base_url=/jupyter/\".",
