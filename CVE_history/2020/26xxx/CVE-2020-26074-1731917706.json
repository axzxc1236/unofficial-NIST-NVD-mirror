An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending requests that contain specially crafted path variables to the vulnerable system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to overwrite arbitrary files, allowing the attacker to modify the system in such a way that could allow the attacker to gain escalated privileges.Cisco&nbsp;has released software updates that address this vulnerability.
