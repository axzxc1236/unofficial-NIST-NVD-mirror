Authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the handling of the ping parameter provided to tools.sh. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied string before using it to execute a system call. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of root. Was ZDI-CAN-10595.",
