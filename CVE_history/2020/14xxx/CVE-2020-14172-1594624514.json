      "oldValue": "Affected versions of Atlassian Jira Server and Data Center allow remote attackers to achieve template injection via the Web Resources Manager. The affected versions are before version 8.8.1.",
      "newValue": "This issue exists to document that a security improvement in the way that Jira Server and Data Center use velocity templates has been implemented. The way in which velocity templates were used in Atlassian Jira Server and Data Center prior to version 8.8.1 allowed remote attackers to achieve remote code execution via insecure deserialization, if they were able to exploit a server side template injection vulnerability."
