      "oldValue": "Red Hat Satellite's external authentication component is vulnerable to a full account takeover flaw. This flaw allows an attacker with an authenticated account on Single sign-on (SSO) to gain elevated privileges of existing local users. This issue only affects users who have configured Satellite to use Apache SSO or Open ID Connect external authentication sources, and that have not disabled the auto-creation of users on login. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability.",
      "newValue": "An account takeover flaw was found in Red Hat Satellite 6.7.2 onward. A potential attacker with proper authentication to the relevant external authentication source (SSO or Open ID) can claim the privileges of already existing local users of Satellite."
