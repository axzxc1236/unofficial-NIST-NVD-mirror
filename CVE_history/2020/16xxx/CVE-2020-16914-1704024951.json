By itself, the information disclosure does not allow arbitrary code execution; however, it could allow arbitrary code to be run if the attacker uses it in combination with another vulnerability.</p>\n<p>To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would have to log on to an affected system and run a specially crafted application.</p>\n<p>The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how GDI+ handles memory addresses.</p>\n"
