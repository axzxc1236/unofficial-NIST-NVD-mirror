An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could retrieve the memory address of a kernel object.</p>\n<p>To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker would have to log on to an affected system and run a specially crafted application.</p>\n<p>The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how the Windows kernel handles memory addresses.</p>\n"
