An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code in kernel mode. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.</p>\n<p>To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would first have to log on to the system. An attacker could then run a specially crafted application that could exploit the vulnerability and take control of an affected system.</p>\n<p>The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how GDI handles objects in memory and by preventing instances of unintended user-mode privilege elevation.</p>\n"
