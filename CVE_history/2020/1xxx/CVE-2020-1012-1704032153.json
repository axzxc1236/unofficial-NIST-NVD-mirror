An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could execute code with elevated permissions.</p>\n<p>There are multiple ways an attacker could exploit the vulnerability:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit this vulnerability and then convince a user to view the website. An attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or in an Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's website, or by opening an attachment sent through email.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>In a file sharing attack scenario, an attacker could provide a specially crafted document file that is designed to exploit this vulnerability, and then convince a user to open the document file.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The security update addresses the vulnerability by ensuring the Wininit.dll properly handles objects in memory.</p>\n"
