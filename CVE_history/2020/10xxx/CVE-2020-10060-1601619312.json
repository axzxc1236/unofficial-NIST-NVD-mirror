If the JSON contained less than two elements, this access would reference unitialized stack memory. This could result in a crash, denial of service, or possibly an information leak. Recommend disabling updatehub until such a time as a fix can be made available. Provided the fix in CVE-2020-10059 is applied, the attack requires compromise of the server.
