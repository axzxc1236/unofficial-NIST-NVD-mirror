There is no sensitive information disclosure through the cache headers on Citrix ADC. The \"Via\" header lists cache protocols and recipients between the start and end points for a request or a response. The \"Age\" header provides the age of the cached response in seconds. Both headers are commonly used for proxy cache and the information is not sensitive."
