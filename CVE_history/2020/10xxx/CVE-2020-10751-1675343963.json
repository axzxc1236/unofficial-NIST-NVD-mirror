      "oldValue": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernels SELinux LSM hook implementation before version 5.7, where it incorrectly assumed that an skb would only contain a single netlink message. The hook would incorrectly only validate the first netlink message in the skb and allow or deny the rest of the messages within the skb with the granted permission without further processing.",
      "newValue": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel’s SELinux LSM hook implementation, where it anticipated the skb would only contain a single Netlink message. The hook incorrectly validated the first Netlink message in the skb only, to allow or deny the rest of the messages within the skb with the granted permissions and without further processing. At this time, there is no known ability for an attacker to abuse this flaw."
