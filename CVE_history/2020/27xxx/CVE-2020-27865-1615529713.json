Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the uhttpd service, which listens on TCP port 80 by default. The issue results from incorrect string matching logic when accessing protected pages. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute code in the context of the device. Was ZDI-CAN-10894.",
