      "oldValue": "A vulnerability has been identified in Nucleus 4 (All versions < V4.1.0), Nucleus NET (All versions), Nucleus RTOS (versions including affected DNS modules), Nucleus ReadyStart (All versions < V2017.02.3), Nucleus Source Code (versions including affected DNS modules), SIMOTICS CONNECT 400 (All versions < V0.5.0.0), VSTAR (versions including affected DNS modules). The DNS response parsing functionality does not properly validate various length and counts of the records. The parsing of malformed responses could result in a read past the end of an allocated structure. An attacker with a privileged position in the network could leverage this vulnerability to cause a denial-of-service condition or leak the memory past the allocated structure.",
