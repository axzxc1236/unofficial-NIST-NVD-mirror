      "oldValue": "This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of D-Link DVA-2800 and DSL-2888A routers. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the dhttpd service, which listens on TCP port 8008 by default. When parsing the path parameter, the process does not properly validate a user-supplied string before using it to execute a system call. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the web server. Was ZDI-CAN-10911.",
