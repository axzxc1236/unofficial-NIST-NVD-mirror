      "oldValue": "This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of D-Link DAP-1860 firmware version 1.04B03 WiFi extenders. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the HNAP service, which listens on TCP port 80 by default. When parsing the Authorization request header, the process does not properly validate a user-supplied string before using it to execute a system call. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the device. Was ZDI-CAN-10880.",
