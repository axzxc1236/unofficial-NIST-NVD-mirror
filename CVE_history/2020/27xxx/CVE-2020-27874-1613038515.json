User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the WXAM Decoder. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a memory access past the end of an allocated object. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-11580.",
