The connection attempt must initiate from a Webex mobile application for either iOS or Android. The vulnerability is due to unintended meeting information exposure in a specific meeting join flow for mobile applications. An unauthorized attendee could exploit this vulnerability by accessing a known meeting ID or meeting URL from the mobile device&rsquo;s web browser. The browser will then request to launch the device&rsquo;s Webex mobile application. A successful exploit could allow the unauthorized attendee to join the password-protected meeting. The unauthorized attendee will be visible in the attendee list of the meeting as a mobile attendee. Cisco has applied updates that address this vulnerability and no user action is required.",
