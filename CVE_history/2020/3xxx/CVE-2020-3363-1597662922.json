An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted IPv6 packet through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause an unexpected reboot of the switch, leading to a DoS condition.\r This vulnerability is specific to IPv6 traffic. IPv4 traffic is not affected.\r ",
