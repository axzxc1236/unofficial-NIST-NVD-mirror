An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted IPv6 packet to an affected device with the goal of reaching the vulnerable section of the input buffer. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.\r This vulnerability is specific to IPv6 traffic. IPv4 traffic is not affected.\r ",
