      "type": "Description",
      "oldValue": "Incorrect username validation in the registration processes of CTFd through 2.2.2 allows a remote attacker to take over an arbitrary account after initiating a password reset. This is related to register() and reset_password() in auth.py. To exploit the vulnerability, one must register with a username similar to the admin, but with spaces inserted before and after the username. This will register the account with the same username as the admin. After a reset of the password for this new account, CTFd will reset the admin account's password due to the username collision.",
      "newValue": "Incorrect username validation in the registration process of CTFd v2.0.0 - v2.2.2 allows an attacker to take over an arbitrary account if the username is known and emails are enabled on the CTFd instance. To exploit the vulnerability, one must register with a username identical to the victim's username, but with white space inserted before and/or after the username. This will register the account with the same username as the victim. After initiating a password reset for the new account, CTFd will reset the victim's account password due to the username collision."
