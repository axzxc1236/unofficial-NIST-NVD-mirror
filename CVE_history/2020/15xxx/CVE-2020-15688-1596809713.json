      "oldValue": "GoAhead before 5.1.2 mishandles the nonce value during Digest authentication. This may permit request replay attacks for local requests over HTTP.",
      "newValue": "The HTTP Digest Authentication in the GoAhead web server before 5.1.2 does not completely protect against replay attacks. This allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to bypass authentication via capture-replay if TLS is not used to protect the underlying communication channel."
