      "oldValue": "An issue was discovered in Gradle Enterprise before 2020.2.5. Lack of the secure attribute on the anti-CSRF cookie allows an attacker (with the ability to read HTTP traffic) to obtain a user's anti-CSRF token if the user initiates a cleartext HTTP request.",
      "newValue": "An issue was discovered in Gradle Enterprise before 2020.2.5. The cookie used to convey the CSRF prevention token is not annotated with the “secure” attribute, which allows an attacker with the ability to MITM plain HTTP requests to obtain it, if the user mistakenly uses a HTTP instead of HTTPS address to access the server. This cookie value could then be used to perform CSRF."
