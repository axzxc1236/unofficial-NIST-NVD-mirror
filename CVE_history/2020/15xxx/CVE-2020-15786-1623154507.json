SIPLUS variants) (All versions), SIMATIC HMI Mobile Panels (All versions), SIMATIC HMI Unified Comfort Panels (All versions). Affected devices insufficiently block excessive authentication attempts. This could allow a remote attacker to discover user passwords and obtain access to the Sm@rt Server via a brute-force attack.",
